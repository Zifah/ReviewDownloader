"L. D. Weller",15-Apr-2017,5,"Very happy with purchase","Finally my family is no longer complaining about WiFi access speeds.  Compared to Small Office/Home Office routers which I've purchased over the years this product was easy to set up and configure and works reliably. Very happy and have recommended it to co-workers and friends who have family embers frustrated with lack of signal in some parts of the house.  I was a little concerned about maintaining enough bandwidth for VOIP but have had no problems so far.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RR14Q259GDYT2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AYDSCPPWPXF9S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"Baradanikto",15-Apr-2017,5,"Replacement for Three TP-Link range extenders","I bought the three unit mesh network to replace three TP-Link POE range extenders.  The range extenders would occasionally drop signals and force me to use a different SSID when I needed a better signal (depending upon the location).  The eero units worked out of the box and provided much better and stronger coverage than the range extenders.  Setup was easy using my Android smartphone.  The only problem I had was with my  Canon wireless printer.  The eero installation sets up a new network with a different IP address scheme.  After installation, I could no longer print because the printer was not ""discovered"".  I had to reset the printer settings and re-install the drivers after pulling the plugs on two eero units.  I needed to pull the plugs because the eero units use the same SSID for each unit.  The printer install would not let me install initially because of the duplicate SSIDs.  Temporarily removing two eero units allowed me to connect the printer to a single unit and finish the install.  Once the printer install was done, I re-plugged the two units and all is well.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2EMNXRZICW3O8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A7KCAN9VNVOBX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"RoadRage",14-Apr-2017,4,"Your mileage may vary","I struggle w/ 4 or 5 stars. I am a engineer and my network maybe was a bit different then the intended audience and I want to be fair if this is at all the cause for my challenges. That being said, if you are looking for a simple to use wifi mesh that will cover a large square footage home, this is a great product and dead simple to install. My only complaint is after initial install the app stated that ""Everything Looks Good"" although I was unable to pass traffic from any wireless connected device. It was not until I went into ""Help-->My Internet is slow-->Run Health Check"" that there was a sign of an issue. I just found this very misleading and as a technical person I did know howto logically troubleshoot but would my friend or family member or would this be a call to the guy who recommends it, me ? The other issue was an undocumented feature that suddenly appeared after a software update that now my wireless devices can not converse with my wired devices, this presents an issue because my wired device is my desktop/media server and now none of my devices can do app hand off in spotify to my desktop.  Another EXCELLENT win for this solution is support, I spoke with a girl who was extremely knowledgeable and courteous and would say this is the best consumer network device support in the industry right now.  Please keep in mind, if you have a very simple cable modem and wireless setup, you may have no issues but I have a cable modem, router, switch, wired VoIP, wired desktops, and now Eero for wifi and there are some challenges.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28HK5MKP0EFZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/ALM31S9O8EWW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"wsconn1",09-Apr-2017,4,"Set up was very easy. The only problem I had was that after ...","These appear to have resolved a problem of spotty wifi around my house.  Set up was very easy.  The only problem I had was that after getting these set up, they auto-updated the software and the app got frozen -- although the eeros themselves were working.  I finally deleted the app and reinstalled it and everything has been good since then.  I am surprised that I do get an occasional message when trying to use my iPad and my Apple TV, both in the same room as an eero, telling me that the signal is too weak.  There is a clear line of sight between all three devices and the Apple TV is close to the eero but a bit lower.  I'll experiment a bit with placement and assume this will be resolved.  Regardless, I would recommend these because of the design, ease of set up and blanket coverage elsewhere in my house.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R367T67OMQQIWF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AH6CRBKET7IFC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

I read online that everyone says they are very warm when on so I decided not to risk future failures and have decided to try the Linksys Velop system.

I cannot say the same for the NETGEAR Nighthawk AC1900 Dual Band Wi-Fi Gigabit Router (R7000) with Open Source Support. Compatible with Amazon Echo/Alexa that I purchased in January 2015 and its companion, the NETGEAR Nighthawk AC1900 Desktop WiFi Range Extender (EX7000-100NAS) purchased in June 2015. At the time, I thought I was out of my mind spending $400 on the eero Home WiFi System (it would've been $500 at the time, but Amazon offered a promo of $100 off), especially considering the amount of money I had already spent on the Netgear Nighthawk equipment. While the Netgear equipment provided fast throughput, I clearly decided 6 mos after purchasing the router that I needed an extender. Also, by 2016 I was experiencing dropouts all the time to the point that I routinely had to cycle the router nearly every day. I could not for the life of me figure out what was going on w/the Netgear router. I was so frustrated that I simply had to try the eero Home WiFi System. To date, I've had no dropouts; no need to cycle power - the eero simply works and is frustration free. I have one in second floor my home office, one in my upstairs bedroom, and the third in a cabinet (supposedly a no-no re: reception) that house my gaming systems, DVR, etc. There are currently 23 connected devices including 2 desktops, 3 laptops, 2 tablets, 3 cell phones, 4 Sonos speakers, 3 streaming devices, 3 Arlo cameras, 1 Ring doorbell camera (which prompted the purchase of the Netgear Extender), multiple Hue lightbulbs, etc. etc. When needed and in use, everything that is on my network works and works well. I never experience buffering issues when streaming music or TV. Web pages load quickly and multiplayer gaming is lag free. I also have a strong signal in my front and back yard! (I'm using this with Comcast Blast Plus!I also like that they are low profile and simply elegant compared to the beastly size and unattractive look of my old Netgear equipment (currently housed in a drawer until I figure out what to do with them). The only draw back I can think of is that there is only one ethernet port. However, that problem is easily solved through the purchase of an ethernet switching device such as the one I purchased for roughly $10: NETGEAR 5-Port Fast Ethernet 10/100Mbps Switch (FS205).  Oh - and I initially had an issue in which I had a problem getting eero to work with my employer's VPN and customer support was quick, friendly and solved the problem. That was the one and only problem I've had with these. All in all, If you're looking for a hassle free solution to router/WiFi issues and you don't mind that you're not going to be able to tweak various settings like QOS, then the eero system is the way to go. Frankly, I don't miss looking at or tweaking the various settings on Netgear's software - I really don't have a need to with the eero since it works as expected. Which is to say that the eero Home Wifi System exceeded my expectations and was definitely worth the expense in order to achieve hassle free WiFi throughout my home (including the yard, attic and basement). Highly, highly recommended.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RIE9270DQORZL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2PO4VFBUEUOI5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"L. Liroff",01-Apr-2017,5,"Very Satisfied.  Easy Set Up.  Works well with Apple Express","I had an existing WiFi with an Apple Time Capsule supplemented by Apple Express's throughout my 2100 square foot, two story house.  The system wasn't working.  Typically, upstairs I was getting speeds in the neighborhood of 3 to 5 mbps.  Not satisfactory to run Airplay well.  So I bought an Eero 3 pack.  Set up was so easy.  Really.  I mean really.  I had trouble getting my Apple Express connected to the Eero system so I could continue to run Airplay.  I got great help from Eero's call center from Nick who talked me through it.  Now my system works seamlessly.  My Apple Express are connected to my Eero Wifi and Apple Airplay works perfectly every time.  Plus I was able to, with Nick's help, connect my Apple Time Capsule to my system so it keeps backing up my system.  The speeds now upstairs consistently run from 25 mbps to 45 mbps.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTYQH5CVQ8XNW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A10IQXU3R3JROE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Kevin Haggard",31-Mar-2017,3,"eero Mesh Wifi Not Magic - Don't Buy If Existing Wifi Setup Works","I purchased these on the hype to replace a set of 3 Apple Airport Express and 1 Apple Airport Extreme that blanketed my house. I had a few problems with moving to room to room on WiFi with the Apple set-up so was willing to try the mesh wifi world. All 4 of my eero's are connected to a switch at home which is connected to the router - which is the same setup I used with the Apple Airports. The couple of issues I have had are:- eero units randomly flashing red lights and not being available - this could be for a few seconds or longer- not playing well with multiple WeMo devices and switches throughout the house- I have had multiple occasions where the wired Internet speeds are 45 Mbps and the eero speeds are less than 10 Mbps with no activity in the houseOn the plus side - I think the iOS software is nicely done.TL;DR - I bought the hype on these units - but don't think the premium is justified. Stick with your old wifi setup if it works. This will not magically make everything better i.e. unicorns riding on rainbows will not deliver stable and fast Internet speeds to every corner of your house.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDATHHYN2HMNG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AU35JOCRE0NGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"Steven D. Arnold",31-Mar-2017,5,"Best-of-breed wifi solution. Excellent!","I've tried many different wifi base stations over time. Most of them were somewhere between decent and unusable. Even high-quality vendors, like Apple's Airport, still kicked my devices and my family's off the network or didn't give good coverage throughout the house (which has four floors), thus resulting in poor or no performance in many cases. I have young children who sometimes watch movies on an iPad, so bad connectivity translates directly to an unpleasant day for me. I have to have a solution that works.One idea I had was to put a different wifi router in each part of the house, hardwired via ethernet. The downside with this is if you connect to the one on the top floor with your phone, and then you walk downstairs, your connectivity is bad. So an interesting idea, but not really practical. And don't even start me on extenders. In my experience, they're all terrible, assuming they work at all, which is often not the case.eevo really solves this problem and does a great job. I got the package of three base stations. I have my own internal network and don't want to connect the eevo directly to the Internet, so I set it up in bridged mode and made it serve a range of DHCP IP addresses. (Note: these are advanced settings, but it's nice to know it's possible to do this.) In my case, all three base stations were connected to house ethernet, which probably helps, but this is not technically necessary, according to eevo. (I did not test this, because I'm happy with my current configuration, and I'm sure at any rate that ethernet will be faster..)The three base stations merged seamlessly into a single wifi network, available throughout the house. The network offers very strong signal (all bars) everywhere. It's the same network, so there's no need to connect to a different network in a different part of the house. The speed is excellent, very comparable to the best wifi routers I've used in the past. And neither I, nor my wife and kids, ever get kicked off the network. It's extremely stable.It did take me a while to figure out I really wanted bridged networking. I just needed eevo to give me wifi DHCP access to my own network, nothing fancy beyond that. Also, the eevo documentation insists that you must plug your primary eevo directly into the service provider's modem, bypassing any firewalls etc, but this is not in fact necessary -- or I should say it might be necessary if your firewall is set up in an overly restrictive manner, but it was not a problem for me. (It might well also have been a problem if bridged networking had not been a sufficient solution for me.) I guess the point here is the docs are less than clear about this.Overall, eevo provides exceptional service in signal, in speed, and in stability, far better for a whole-house solution than anything else I've ever tried -- and I've tried many, many different things over the years. It's a clear winner and if your needs and problems match those I described, I strongly recommend that you give eevo a try.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OZ1PWMU91ULK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1VCZU26BQI13/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

My first attempts failed on a successful mesh network using AT&T Uverse DSL, I followed the setup process and googled and tried what others suggested. Eero just did not work as advertised on AT&T.Fast forward to 6 months later after being frustrated with AT&T speeds I switched over to Wave Broadband and got the 250 Mbps down and 10 Mbps package. Initially I took there generic cable modem/wifi router. What a disappointment, I had better speeds than with AT&T however I was not getting what I paid for. So I decide to purchase my own cable modem (Arris SB6190 Surfboard) and the eero system again. After a few kinks getting everything setup and the eero updates they system has been working flawlessly. I now have complete mesh wifi coverage at full speeds and more in my entire house. I know the eero system is very pricey however it really works and to me it was worth every penny.Bottom line is eero really works and it works well on Wave Broadband.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R348OBEHJASGGZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3JY9TO4XRTC9Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

While they started out slower than the linksys, they were still fast enough for everything we needed. The problem comes that within a week or two the speed drops off to almost nothing. I had my macbook pro literally 2 feet from one of the hardwired base stations. I was getting 2mbps. I restarted the base station (which requires you to unplug/plug it back in). After it came back up, I was getting 180mbps again. Not having to restart the eeros was the only reason I bought them (i.e. rock solid wifi). Their support was fairly good, but we never could get them to work 100%. So, I returned them. At this point, I'm back to using 4 airport extremes (all hardwired) around my house.

Mangan",27-Mar-2017,5,"Delivers as advertised & and responsive customer service!","My long time network configuration - an Apple Time Capsule with Apple Airport Expresses as network extenders finally had to be ""retired"" because network performance was becoming inconsistent. It served me well for years; however, I could never get a solid wifi signal throughout my home, nor the performance throughput I was paying for with Comcast.Got tired of my wife complaining about as the signal degradation the past year. Watch the Eero video on their web site.....it is spot on. I was doing everything the guy in the video was doing. I purchased Eero's products, because I didn't want to deal with a non-consumer friendly, poorly designed, and less than stellar performance networking solution. I did look at competing mesh networking products, but chose Eero for the favorable customer experience.Set-up was as easy as everyone has written about. Just plug the devices in as instructed, and everything was recognized by their iOS app. Took a few minutes on my devices were all online. I kept my same network name as my old one and the same network password, so all my devices were recognized.Only task I had to do was update the firmware. The firmware update done via their iOS app and the network worked perfectly after upgrade. The only extra thing I did was assign a unique name to every device on my network. I did not care if I didn't have all the configuration parameters like I did with my Apple set-up, because I never used the overly technical settings to begin with.I now have 17 unique devices on the network with no reported problems. This includes one Nest thermostat, three Nest smoke alarms, one Apple time machine network drive, two iPads, two iPhones, one Apple TV, one Amazon Fire stick, one Apple iMac, one Apple MacBook Pro, and a five others for good measure. No lags, no offline conditions, etc. It appears to just work.Observations:- Easy to install and set-up.- Eero constantly improving their software and features. Very easy to see how committed they are to making this a best in class product.- iOS app is straight forward. No bloated app design. They keep it simple and clean. No way to get lost in it.- App allows you to turn off the device indicator light.- Covers my two-story home with consistent high throughput wifi coverage.- Responsive customer service. When one of my devices failed after 48 hrs. I called Eero and got a live person who spoke English...they shipped a replacement device immediately. All I had to do was return the defective device in the package with pre-paid shipping label. Easy.- Easy online Help information. Again, information is easy to find/search for, well composed, and offers easy to follow instructions.- Delivers a consistent and available connection across my 2200 foot two story home. Check out the awesome performance I am getting in the picture I posted.Misc.- One satellite device failed after 48 hrs, but Eero replaced it immediately (thank you Eero).- When checking the wifi performance via the iOS app, it is not clear how the network speed results are determined. It would be nice know which device it is testing the network throughput from. When I test with Speedtest.net, I get a totally different network performance number. I don't know why. Maybe another user can enlighten me. I did notice when I check the network speed on multiple devices with the Eero app....they all activate. Interesting, no issue on that, just my curiosity why?- I wish the devices were smaller in footprint like the Apple Airport Express.No showstoppers, a positive customer experience, and my wife is happy with her husband again.Thank you Eero, keep up the good work!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1E4AZST9CPNCP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1T5BC1E4NESOY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Steven",24-Mar-2017,5,"Best WiFi I have ever owned!","My house was built in 1969.  It is a double split-level and has steel beams in between the floors.  It has been near impossible to get acceptable WiFi in my house since we moved here in 2003.  I have spent hundreds, maybe thousands of dollars in attempts to get WiFi to cover most most of my house.  Multiple zones and APs.  Powered antennas.  WiFi boosters.  Nothing worked well.  I have been using ethernet over power adapters up until now because of this.  I had attempted to use mesh routers in the past, but they were enterprise class and too expensive or hard to manage.  So eero has been a breath of fresh air.  They have been exactly as they were described.  I love the fact that there is no manual.  Just download the app and go.  I plugged the first into my gigabit router, worked as expected.  The next one I was expecting issues.  I have had so many problem going from the office to the living room.  Number 2, no issue.  Wow!  Ok, number 3 in the upstairs solarium.  No issue.  I could not believe it.  There are no more dead spaces in my house.  No more putting my phone outside the kitchen to play streaming music because I couldn't get coverage.  Before eero I had also recently moved to gigabit ethernet for my internet service and was so disappointed that I was getting a fraction of the speed to my devices.  It seemed like a complete waste.  Now I am getting optimal speeds for the wireless technology and actually seeing the difference in having gigabit.  I've already recommended to a friend and he bought there right then and there based on my testimony alone.  I can easily say, these are the best WiFi routers I have ever owned and I no longer worry about if my WiFi is working.  Thanks eero!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FWAWYKVH4HM5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3CWRR1SL9ZNFP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

However if you want to locate them in a cabinet you will need to take measures to avoid overheating.  I put rubber feet on the units to increase ground clearance and drilled some discreet ventilation holes in the cabinet.

"Bill",18-Mar-2017,5,"Great purchase, Highly recommend","This is simply an exceptional product.  In summary, it was relatively easy to set up and provides strong, fast coverage across my home.  Prior to installing, download the app and set your phone to cellular with bluetooth on (turn off wifi on your phone).  Follow directions setting up the base device (I believe they are exactly the same but I will refer to the 1st device as the base).  You might want to conduct a software update at this time but I'm not sure it really matters.  Let the app lead you thru the set up of your satellite devices which should be line of sight and 40 feet or so away.  I did run into problems with the second phase as I was experiencing a bluetooth glitch.  I eventually called tech support which was fantastic!  They quickly answered and solved the issue.  The completion of the set up was a breeze from that point on.  I was told that this wasn't a common issue but its nice to know that the support line was this good.  I was working off of an Apple time capsule prior to installing the Eero device and it lost coverage and speed across the my house.  The difference is simply striking!  I could average 5 - 20 Mbs download depending upon the room I was in except for the extreme points in the house where is was a crap shot as to signal.  Now my coverage is 25 - 40 Mbs in the far reaches of my home.  Note: the Eero app seems to test your potential speed not the actual speed (it seems to regularly give 60Mbs as metric).  So I was using another speed test.

"milodaman",15-Mar-2017,1,"Product issues and dubious company policies"," I hate to have to write this review as I really wanted these Eero's to work. However, as it turns out, my old apple airports never had the issues I experienced until I switched over to Eero. Once I switched back to the old airports, all the following issues went away.Frequent DropsAs seen in the attached video, you'll notice that the throughput goes up and down every 30-45 seconds, which is significant enough that it causes streaming music to pause frequently. Of course streaming video was a non-starter. I spent over a month trying to debug this with Eero support with no luck. Note that this issue happens no matter the distance to the access point.ConnectivityMost of my devices connect fine. However, I have a couple of devices that seem to have connectivity problems on a regular bases. One of my MacBook Pro's required me to hard code an IP in order to maintain a connection. Same issue was found with an iPad as well. Note that this issue happens no matter the distance to the access point.CompanyIt's also important to note that I tried to work with the company to resolve these issues for a couple of months. I started the process with Eero Support within the first month, creating videos and providing long detailed explanations regarding the behaviors. They logged into my devices remotely to monitor the behavior and also sent me a custom firmware.  However, now that it seems like they won't be able to fix the issues, I asked for a refund. However, eero refused because they said it was over a month since I purchased the product. I explained that this hardly seemed fair given I, in good faith, worked with their support organization to resolve their product issues, conversations which started BEFORE the month mark. I would recommend folks thinking about purchasing an eero make sure you quickly confirm the performance of the product and return the product right away if any issues are all are found instead of working with Support given this policy.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37EQ6K8IQ6LD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3OMP7FQM82DCP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"G. Thompson",12-Mar-2017,5,"Excellent signal strength; Idiot-Proof Installation","We had an older WiFi with an extender that gave us constant headaches -- we often had to unplug the units several times a day and signal strength was uneven throughout our large house. After doing research on the eero vs. Google's unit, we decided on the eero not only because of the good reviews (in Amazon and in the technical press) but also because Google requires you to make the unit part of the ever-creeping Google ecosystem that watches everything you do in searches, emails, and the like, and adds it to the profile it keeps for you in order to sell ads more targeted to how they have you categorized. I would rather have my WiFi system just do its work without whispering about me to Google in the background!The system is dead easy to set up -- literally, we just plugged and played, following the directions in the app. It worked right out of the box. Since installing eero, we have had flawless service - no interruptions and signal strength throughout the house is high.The design of the units is sleek and unobtrusive. Although we didn't need to ask for help, apparently the support offered is excellent.This works as well as any modern internet product we have put into service in recent years.

I have each of them connected to the backbone using Netgear PLP1200 Powerline adapters, so the communication between units is very fast.  I get full upload/download speed via my ISP and extremely fast communication between computers inside my home.Unfortunately, I did run into a limitation.  I like to use a non-standard network range inside my house.  This way, when I travel with my laptop, the hotel will not assign me an IP address from that range, so the personal firewall will not think it is on my home network.  The eero configuration will only let me choose addresses from RFC 1918 (10.0.0.0, 172.16.0.0 or 192.168.0.0).  I prefer to use 6.6.6.0 /24 since I figure no hotel would ever assign me an IP from that range.  I have done this for years using various routers, but the DHCP settings of the eero just will not allow it.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MU3YQ8L3UW65/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A26SNCU5287VJT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

Over the years we've experimented with different consumer-grade access points (Linksys, Asus, TP-Link, etc) and always had the same issue.  If you sat close to the AP you had excellent service.  As soon as you got a good 20-30 feet from the unit it all went downhill.  We're in a highly congested building in NYC so there's a ton of channel contention.  We considered business-class mesh hardware/software from all of the major manufacturers; Ubiquity, Ruckus, etc.  Unfortunately the pricing and learning curve was going to be substantially more than we were willing to invest.  After much debate we decided to buy six eero units and place them throughout the office in bridge mode.  We couldn't be happier!!!  Setup was unbelievably easy and the system is very reliable.  We regularly have anywhere between 50 to 70 devices (combination of Nest cameras, tablets, phones, and laptops) connected to the system and performance/throughput is solid.We get it, these aren't necessarily meant for business use but quite honestly, if you're a small business and don't want to hire an engineer to install and maintain expensive hardware this may work for you.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3L4HM81UP430I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AG8P99C7CUQD5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"D. Day",20-Feb-2017,1,"Bad for remote access.","It's not working at all for remote database access.  Nothing needed to be configured on the previous Apple AirPort Extreme to allow remote access.  However with Eero, we had to set up port forwarding.  After the port forwarding set up, it got messier from there.  We were only able to access the database from out-of-home network or cell data.  When we are in the Eero network, we'll receive a server not reachable error message.  Eero tech support said they will consider this feature.  I am not sure what feature they are talking about.It's a great device if you are only using it for web, email, and other stuff.  But I'd avoid it if you need any remote access to your home network.

The install is easy and the app is very well-designed.  We have as many as 25 connected devices including computers, tablets, TVs, Amazon Echos (5 of them!), Ring doorbells & cameras, Hue lights, WEMO switches etc. and the network is rock solid.  There is no more yelling from our son's area in the far end of the house.  Note we have a house with older and probably odd construction so even line-of-sight from the old router wasn't working too well.  As I write this we are getting 109 down Mbps / 12 up.  The most I've noticed is 115 down.  No more daily router reboots from the cable modem in fact I haven't rebooted them at all since installation.  Netflix performance is very much improved and rarely goes out.  My guess is that the other router was having issues so the connections were varying in speed.  For us Eero is worth every dollar as Internet peace reigns supreme in our home.

I would always think ""I didn't stop paying for that internet - it's still there, and I shouldn't have to coax a device into communicating with my router"".Also the design is pleasing, the squared-off white hockey puck doesn't look like much wherever it's placed, and the cord from the bit that plugs into the wall outlet is long enough that you have placement options.It's also cool that you can programmatically turn off the little white 'on' light","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2POPD42BFGH7J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2OZ2OXUBK5SKK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

This is a deal breaker for me so back it goes. I called their support to confirm and I will say, I got a real human, on a weekend, who spoke perfect English, within about a minute and no complicated menus, so that was cool. But still - he said there's no way to do set up without a cell phone number.I'm just going to pick up some WiFi APs from the local electronics store, put them in bridge mode and put them on the existing wired network. The way this system works, it takes the place of your router and I use my router's NAT features for a few wired home automation services, cameras, gaming, etc. so I wouldn't be able to use the routing function of these access points anyway. They basically end up acting as expensive, bridges WiFi access points. Even if I were using the Eeros access points as routers, I don't really buy the claim that the home router is the bottleneck. Doesn't seem to make sense that a gigabit router would be the bottleneck on a 50Mb Comcast circuit. But hey, I'm no network engineer, who knows.Mostly annoyed about the phone number though.

"David S.",19-Feb-2017,5,"Solve your home wifi problems once and for all with this unit!","This new technology is as good an improvement as I could have hoped for.  I have Comcast high speed internet, very fast and I use the latest Apple Airport Extreme for my router.  We have a large house (3700 square feet) and we have many bad spots with poor speed.  For example my Apple Macbook Air in our kitchen sometimes is as slow as 2-5 mbps, while if I put the laptop next to the router (which is upstairs) I can get 100-175 mbps.  I also noticed that Apple has announced they are getting out of the router business--that suggested to me they realize their technology isn't keeping up and perhaps they don't want to invest in this area.  So I bought the 3-pack Eero and set it up, total time probably 20-25 minutes.  I chose to sort of triangulate my house, two units upstairs at each end of the house and one in the kitchen.  Despite the fact that Eero says it may take 24 hours to get up to full speed I am getting 125-175 mbps everywhere---yeehaa!  My Facetime to London was better and my Ring doorbell videos are much better.  One tip for setting it up:  Eero said to plug in the first unit and the modem simultaneously,  but the Comcast modem takes about a minute to connect so the Eero unit seemed to be struggling to connect.  I would suggest plugging in the modem first, let it show all the lights up and running, then plug in the Eero.  One other thought; some online reviews complain about the somewhat higher price of the Eero vs. Google wifi versus Orbi for example.  I think this is a mistake.  Having the best and fastest wifi in one's home is about as important as anything you have running in your house.  I am willing to pay extra for the best solution which this clearly is.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36KMB5YHQ5SD3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A32OP25V8S8WZT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

Apple instead discontinued their Airports. I was a little hesitant at the switch to eero. I've used non Apple routers before, and was somewhat dreading the set up. I opened the box and then down loaded the app to my iPhone. It walked me through the set up like a stroll in the park. Set up number one, then it asked if I wanted to do another and then again for the third. I options for network control were easy to see and work. Family member restrictions for the children were easier than on the airport. The look and feel was more Apple like than Apples own products. I wish I'd switched earlier. Streaming to my AppleTVs has improved with less buffering. Streaming live TV through my HDHomerun extend has improved markedly. For people considering chord cutting that have multiple TVs, eero is a must have upgrade for your wifi.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BUZNX29NXUDD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A207J15HNH4HA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

The company service team is also top notch, via email or the phone. the ability to run tests remotely, check at your configuration, reboot the network its great.

"Amazon Customer",16-Feb-2017,5,"Seamless operation & full home coverage","Even though I had purchased a high end router, I found I still needed to use a range extender ((also high end) to cover all areas of our 1800 sq ft main level with full basement home. I was having two continuing issues. First issue, I was having to reboot the system often, sometimes more than once daily. Secondly, because I had the router in the basement and the range extender on the main level, when I walked from the main level (connected to the range extender) to the basement, the phone would automatically switch connection to the router. When I returned upstairs, the phone would remain connected to the router which was not strong enough strength to do anything so I would have to go to wifi settings on the phone & manually select it for the range extender. Not a big deal unless you travel to the basement like I do probably 20 times daily.I stumbled on something discussing the Eero system and then read many reviews on them and other whole house wifi systems. I decided to purchase a three Eero pack. It was super easy to install, it has been over three months and I have not had to reboot one time, and because my phone sees it as one wifi connection, I can now travel throughout the house with strong signal strength and internet speed.I have one in the basement, one on the main level, and the third one connected to an older TiVo that does not have wireless connection - connected to the Eero ethernet port.For me, it proved to be the end of frustration  of a system that just wasn't working well.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RD9N5FV81B4MR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2J8G951PU68LR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Y. Leventhal",15-Feb-2017,5,"A happy customer-Instant gain of 2x of the wifi speed upon eero installation","Got the eero's this afternoon. It took me no time to set up. Unplugged my Apple Time Machine, plugged in one of the eeros, started up the eero app on my phone--viola! Everything started to work. I tested the wireless speed at various places in the house before and after eeros: In most of the areas the speed increased 2x, just like that! In a couple of ""dead"" zones, the speed went up 3x (to where the speed was right by the Time Machine). Like one reviewer said, the laws of physics still apply: In the farthest corner of the house (including one of the ""dead"" zones), the speed is only ½ of the speed in the other areas of the house, but totally usable now (unlike before eero). My Apple TV used to be connected by a cable (the wifi was too slow). I connected the Apple TV via the wireless just to see if that works--the connection was FAST.One eero is in a room separated from the rest of the house by a set of heavy duty sliding glass doors. The other one is about 30+ feet away, equal distance from one end of the house to the other (where the other eero is). I am pretty certain 2 eeros are sufficient, but if not, I can add another one.It took me a while to make up my mind to ditch the Apple router and extenders. I loved my Apple products, but the wifi just never fast enough even for basic web browser. I switched the network from hidden to not hidden, added extenders, tweaked the modem settings (to the extent I could find instructions), nothing helped. I paid extra for faster speed--didn't make a dent. Before buying the eeros, I agonized over what to do with my 3-year old Apple Time Machine. Well, once I saw how fast the wifi was with eeros, no more worries. I will still use the Time Machine for backup, but that's it.I am not sure what makes the wifi gain 2x the speed with eeros (am not referring to the ""mesh"" effect either), but the speed gain plus the mesh (aka blanketing) effect really makes a difference with tricky situations. So far I am very very happy.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GRY286EQN0TH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2UVJIJ26VR8AY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

I don't know how much of the improvement to internet speed over wifi that I've enjoyed since installing both can be credited to Eero versus the new modem or the combination of the two, but we do seem to have far better speed and coverage throughout our house.  We do not pay for business-class service through our cable provider, just a slightly upgraded conventional service, but before installing Eero, my internet connection in my office upstairs was slow as molasses -- online speed tests showed download speeds of anywhere from 2 to 6 Mbps, and now I'm consistently around 50 Mbps, according to the Eero app.  We've had only the occasional hiccup with streaming music or video entertainment with the new setup, most of which we do in the upstairs areas of our house.  My only gripe, and it's no fault of the Eero, is that I had to reinstall all three of our Nest smoke detectors after setup, which required pulling them out of the ceiling and resetting them all.

I've been using the system for about a month now and I'm quite satisfied with the product. Setup was a breeze and took only a few minutes. One of the units was defective, and died shortly after setup. Upon calling support, I was delighted to have the phone answered on the second ring by a real human being who was knowledgeable, and spoke English. He immediately had a new unit shipped out. While waiting for its arrival, I set up with the remaining two units, and found they were adequate to cover my entire 4,500 square foot house! Now, with three units going, I have great coverage in every nook and cranny, and the signal has not dropped once. It works flawlessly, and invisibly. I dropped one star only because the bottoms of the units seem to run warm, although thus far  it hasn't  affected performance.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YP6LXXD3L2VG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A27FSWG0F19GN3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Amazon Customer",11-Feb-2017,5,"I was skeptical, but I am SO happy I bought this!","Our house was the dreaded dead zone. The modem/router was in the room directly above our living room, yet we would still have trouble keeping a wifi connection on the smart tv in the living room. I was so angry, paying for the highest internet speed but dropping connections all the time! We had tried 3 different internet companies, and a wifi extender, plus we tried two different modems on our current internet provider...to no avail. I was convinced that I would forever have to deal with buffering and rebooting devices. A few weeks back I googled ""how to get rid of dead wifi zones"" and several articles about ""mesh"" wifi came up...then it dawned on me that my company has mesh wifi for our building of 12,000 people, so I know it works! I saw this company had good reviews, and a lot of the happy customers had had all of the same experiences I did, which were fixed by Eero.Oh. My. God. I wish I had this years ago! Installation was really easy, and as soon as the devices were hooked up I was running around the house streaming YouTube/Netflix/Amazon Fire Stick on every tv, and every computer simultaneously...No buffering on anything! I have not had any connection problems since that day.I was sent a new modem by Spectrum today (since they bought time warner) and I did have trouble reconfiguring the eero with the new modem. However, after spending 3 hours on the phone with Spectrum I gave up and called Eero, and they were able to walk me through every step. They did a lot of the work remotely on their side, updating the network and explaining the reason the new modem didn't automatically recognize the device. I was good to go, and now everything works brilliantly with the new modem.

Worse, one of the three just died 4 days after the return window, Eero said they can't help with a return. I'm really frustrated.The first issue is Netflix wouldn't connect through it. I spent about 4 hours trying to diagnose it setting things up in different ways, calling Samsung (who makes the BluRay) and Netflix. Then spending an hour with Eero support only to conclude it couldn't be fixed. (It doesn't work with a Sony BluRay I have either.) I bought two more, newer Samsung BluRays, but they didn't work either. I returned those and got a Google Chromecast, which does work great. It's a first world problem, as is the fact that I now need two devices to watch Netflix or BluRays, but better wifi is what I paid for, right?Another odd issue that may or may not be related is that apps won't download on our iPhones or iPad anymore, they hang up partway through the download, I have to connect to my phone carrier and download them from there, which works fine.At this point, I've spent over 15 hours trying to get Eero working right. I'm tired. I want to send it back. But I can't return it because the third unit died 2/8, the return window closed 1/31. So I just burned $400. You might try Google's equivalent product instead.

We recently purchased and renovated a two story 3,500 sqft house for our new office. The house was built in the early part of the 1800's. the walls on this house are 12"" thick and solid concrete and brick. I was very concerned that I was going to struggle to get wifi signal properly dispersed into all the rooms of the building.I put the first AP on the main floor. The other two are upstairs in different offices. I did a thorough site survey and am getting very strong signal in every room and around the outside perimeter of the building. This was true even with our mobile devices.The initial installation was remarkably simple to on my iPhone 7 using the EERO app. One of the valuable ""extra"" features of this system are the duavailable Ethernet ports on the back of each device. My office manager uses a tower-style PC. It has no wireless capability. His office has no hardwired Ethernet ports in it. We were able to put one of the EERO devices in his office and run an Ethernet cable from the device over to his PC. He gets excellent connectivity and function.I am very particular about my tech and expect it to perform as best as is possible.

Enter Eero that has a bridge mode that allows you keep your existing network architecture if you need it. Installation was supposed to be plug and play but it failed on a firmware update.  While customer support was very responsive and friendly, I basically had to find my own way to update the firmware on one recalcitrant unit.

"Entrope",08-Feb-2017,5,"Excellent streaming ability, even with multiple 1080p cameras","Feb 8, 2017 update:They just released the 2.2.0 firmware update yesterday.  It is supposed to have fixed delays in switching access points when roaming, down to something like 50ms, among other things.  This problem affected people using WiFi calling on Apple devices, where the call might drop if moving about.  Also, I did notice streaming apps would lose connection when the connection dropped.  It does appear to be better, but have yet to extensively test, but support page feedback looks very positive.  They do update firmware every month or two, and actively post on their community and reddit pages.  One positive I want to mention is that streaming performance outside, where I used to have serious issues by the pool, appears to be much better now than with my old (but recent) Apple router, even though the main node is placed in the same room as before (and is closest to the pool).  Looking forward to seeing how well this works this summer.  So while there are cheaper options out there, this does have very good customer support and a much more mature product than something like the Google WiFi.  Also noticed that Wifi signal is unaffected while a microwave oven is on--I was able to stream on my phone while sitting right next to it, which is a pleasant surprise.  One more thing.  Be wary of critical reviews containing outdated info, especially the featured ones here.  Firmware updates move quickly (for the networking space), so you should really go to the Eero community support or reddit pages to get the most current feedback so you don't pass over the product due to negative reviewers who won't update/remove their reviews because they'll lose their up votes.Original:This replaced an Airport Extreme and 2 Airport Express extenders. One issue with the old setup is that when moving around the house, devices would stay locked with degraded unusable connections for too long and not switch. Another is that I needed to get streaming to work flawlessly because I am planning to add multiple Nest Cam Outdoor Security Camera 2 pack. Once I added a Skybell HD I could see issues because that device gets bogged down an unreliable without a very robust WiFi signal. While moving the Express around helped, I could still see the signal strength fluctuate even when connected to it, just located on the other side of the wall. Also, with one Nest cam streaming continuously, there would be hiccups with that stream when the Skybell was also recording. All these issues seem to have disappeared since installing the Eeros, and now I've ordered another two Nest cams and upgraded the Skybell to use full 1080 video instead of degraded 480 or 720 options.Installation was very very easy. I mean not a single issue with the Eeros themselves, but I did disable/enable Wifi on two Macs and reboot of a Slingbox 500. I appreciated that they allow you to do configure some advanced networking features, and while there does not appear to be user configurable QoS yet, their web page says there is a basic implementation in place, and that they may offer more capabilities.Even if you don't buy this mesh networking product, most people would be better off with one over a traditional router because these vendors are actively competing on features and performance with aggressive firmware updates, and the only thing a tradition router will get is a once in a blue moon security update. On that note, I would discourage people from an Orbi, since that appears to be a gussied up Netgear with the latest specs. Once you take a look at the browser configuration interface, it will be very familiar to anyone who has had a Netgear router, devoid of any imagination or cutting edge features or modern interface. No useful info about clients offered. At least for the Eero, I could not find a single review claiming the routers needed periodic rebooting, as we are all accustomed to, even with the Apple products (though better than Dlink or Netgear routers).Eero is the one recommended by Leo Laporte, as I saw on his feed, though since Eero is a sponsor, objectivity could be compromised. I was seriously thinking about the Amplifi since the router itself is uber cool, but I had issues with the very large satellites and their orientation, as well as a number of reviews suggesting things like poor performance or quality control issues. One thing that sold me about the Eero is their claim that their implementation performs active routing, as you will see on the blog post explaining the TrueMesh technology. So if one node is busy, it can reroute traffic to another, which makes these satellites behave more like routers actually employing an active routing protocol. From speaking with Amplifi tech support, I was not convinced that the roaming functionality would work seamlessly, but I can't speak from first hand experience. While I might buy and try still, so far I'm content with the Eeros.Let me say that some of the earlier reviews, say pre-Nov 17 2016, do not have the benefit of using the 2.x firmware. I fully expect many reviews addressing performance as a concern are out of date since they don't reflect current reality. My unit shipped with 1.2 firmware, and once I updated to 2.1, the WAN throughput doubled from 55Mbps to 110Mbps, my ISP limit. I may pay another $10 per month to upgrade my ISP speed once I get enough Nest cams to tax my upper limit (11Mbps) on the upload. From the Nest webpage, each cam at 1080p uses 450 Kbps (0.45 Mbps) upload on average, and 1.2Mbps max, so really I should be well under the ISP max with a number of camera streaming. The 802.11ac protocol, used by the Eeros, supports 1.3 Gbps, or 1331 Mbps, so for anyone curious, the protocol between the Eeros should have more than ample room to support numerous 1080 streams, plus a 4K stream with ease.Upgrading firmware was easy--I just pushed the option in the IOS app to upgrade, and it proceeded to upgrade all three devices. Even those with recent purchases may not have taken the initiative to update the firmware, so that is something to consider when reading reviews since most people don't report what they are using.I did seriously consider the Google Wifi, but was concerned about the immaturity and lack of any advanced features. It might work for average users, but for instance, from what I read you cannot even specify a preferred subnet. While perhaps that might change with future updates, with the Eero you get a maturing product, versus a very new Google product. The one concern I have with Eero is the high price.  I guess you would want to buy this if you want superior customer support with a lot of attention placed on advancing the product's capabilities.  And probably because it is, at this point, more mature than a number of recent offerings.One thing that bothered me before purchasing was the lack of line of sight that they recommend. My primary router is in a corner room, and not central in the house, and invariably goes through drywall covered walls. I was researching Power over Ethernet to use a a backhaul to the Eero satellites, but decided to setup and test without POE. So far, I can say I don't see a reason I will ever need to use POE with these existing two satellites. One issue with what I found on POE products offered on amazon is that I would be worried about periodic rebooting and troubleshooting of those devices. So my advice for anyone similarly concerned about line of sight is to try it naked first and figure out a way to place within rooms that minimizes obstructions. Obviously, anyone with Cat 6 interior cabling already installed would want to use that.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RY7EYJB9S4AU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3AR7AKM2MFO0S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"gregf1082",06-Feb-2017,5,"I am very happy with EERO!","I purchased  3 pack several weeks ago to replace an old set of routers I had at my previous house.  I moved to a 2000 square foot ranch house that is spread out more than my old house. The old routers and extenders were not handling everything thoughout the house and yard.  When I moved I purchased a 75MB service.  The best service I could get from the old routers inside the house was 29MB.  After hearing about EERO on the podcast IOS Today I started reading the reviews for the EERO over several weeks I finally decided to purchase the 3 pack.  It was amazing how easy it  was to install the three units.  I did not have any probems getting them up and running. The modem is down in the basement so the first EERO is down there next to the modem.. The next one is on the main level in the middle of the house to the front of the house in the office.  The third one is about 30 feet away from the one in the basement but on the main level on the back side of the house.  Coverage is fantastic inside the house, the garage  and out in the front yard and back yard!  I now receive the 75MB that I am paying for and have great coverage everywhere!  I like the idea that the system will be updated automatically.  Everyone in the family is happy that we have made the move to EERO!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RA1BMMC0IMR4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2ZPA2GWSU8OS7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

My experience has been bad with lots of dropped wireless connections.  When using a mobile device such as an iPhone, it will occasionally drop wireless for a second or two.  This is with me being about 20ft from the router and not moving.  It can do this several times in a 15 to 20 minute window.  I have contacted their Tech support a couple of times, and all they say is reboot the eero and you phone.  I didn't pay this kind of money for a router that I have to constantly reboot.  I even tried running with just one Eero and had the same results.Their mobile app is nice, but their gateway hardware or software (don't know which) is crap.

"Joe Johnson",03-Feb-2017,2,"Meh, not great depending on how you use it","While I never dropped wifi completely, as promised in their marketing stuff, the problem with not dropping is how poor performance can get before it does drop.

I'd watch my signal meter in the MacBook change from high to low and back like a yo-yo at all times. On the nice side, I had basic connectivity all the way into the elevator in my building, a good 50 meters from the AP, but often I had no signal from across the unobstructed room.Pros:-Signal never dropped, like ever. Would work 50M away through walls and concrete with (limited) connectivity-Able to use Facebook and Skype and other basic services without issue-Streamed video up to 1080P on my Amazon Fire TV which was 1-2 feet awayCons:-Sometimes at close range I would have unusable wifi, connected but so choppy it was useless-Video at 1080P was rare, often the best I could get was 2-3Mbps 720P on Fire TV-Text services were good but media services suffered big time","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JQ42V7JPBHR9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3MVMHW3R5MGHB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

Power on second unit about 30' away from first unit. Second unit refused to admit that it was close enough to the first unit to function at about 30' away.  Setup refuses to continue until it is close enough.3. Move second unit to 20' away, setup still says it's too far away.4. Move second unit to 10' away, setup still says it's too far away.5. Move second unit to 1' away, setup still says it's too far away.6. Return to main menu; alert tells me system needs an update; attempt update; update fails after 15 minutes.7. Attempt update again; update succeeds on first unit but fails on second unit.8. Check if updated first device fixed distance issue.  Nope.9. Consult Google.10. Hard wire second device to first device.  Ok, now it's close enough.  But when I unplug it, it's no longer close enough.11. Hard reset everything and start over.12. Connect first unit to modem.13. Hard wire second device to first device and complete addition to network.14. Hard wire third device via switch (since first device only has two ethernet ports) and complete addition to network.15. While everything is still wired together, install all updates.16. Unplug and distribute units, which now seem to think that a little distance is fine.Total installation time: 5-6 hours.Required equipment: another router or switch to temporarily create a network that all 3 units can be hardwired into, and so that you can continue to have internet to Google the solutions to all of this nonsense.Conclusion: set-up process needs SERIOUS WORK.Now that it's actually working, so far it appears to be working fine.

It's definitely way more expensive.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KA348X9HGPH7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/ACPN9IXP6HDV9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"ACR",02-Feb-2017,1,"EERO has alot of room for improvement.  Unfortunately, recent firmware upgrades have degraded bandwidth severely.","I have a network that consists of 9 EERO access points.  I purchased the first 6 before the company was even producing the product and became a beta tester.  Initially I was very pleased with the wifi coverage and bandwidth that was usually in the range of 20-45Mbps down and 90Mbps upload as measured by the EERO app.  My house is older and constructed with cement (cinder) blocks.  Previous to the eero it was nearly impossible to obtain wifi coverage from one end of the house to the other.  I used wifi repeaters, boosters, high gain antennas,  etc.  The house is single story.  Recently, EERO uploaded firmware upgrades (OS v2.2.0-2478) to all of my units and the entire network has fallen apart.  My download speed has dropped to  3-13 Mbps with upload speeds remaining in the 90Mbps range.  This is measured using eero's own app that supposedly measures the bandwidth at the gateway EERO.  I have measured the bandwidth with my laptop and desktop plugged into the same router and they consistently will measure download speeds of 93-96Mbps and upload speeds of 97-99Mbps as measured by Ookla speedtest.  I have emailed customer support on numerous occasions.  I have sent customer support a floorplan with the layout of the EERO mesh network including distances between the various eero access points.  I have moved the access points closer together, rebooted and implemented recommended ""fixes"".  What is particularly concerning is the fact only 3 of the 9 units have a signal that is considered good and the other 6 consistently have a signal that is rated poor by the EERO app.  This was not the case until this firmware upgrade.  I have asked for some answers but have not received any.  I guess it is time to chunk EERO and give Netgear's ORBI or Linksys Velop a try.  I will update this review if the mesh network starts to work as designed.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BFAIRWCU4DRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3H9GDGMJEQ8QW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Mal JD",31-Jan-2017,5,"Solved the weak wi-fi signal in 1920s home","I live with my family of four in a two storey 1800 square foot house built in the 1920s. The house is not open plan and the walls are mostly lath and plaster. Typically we have a dozen or more devices competing for bandwidth. I had been “surviving” on the modem/router (gateway) supplied by Comcast, but the wi-fi signal to most parts of my house was weak at best. In the living room it was often less than one Mbps. In the upstairs bedrooms it was frequently less than five Mbps.Before spending significant dollars on an Eero or Google wifi product, I purchased a new modem and new router, the latter a Linksys WRT1900ACS (I’ve since returned it). While it received good reviews for range, it made only marginal improvement in my home. In the living room where I plan to put a smart TV, it was still averaging under 10Mbps. So I decided to spring for one of the new mesh systems. I would have purchased Google wifi based upon the reviews, but they are out of stock everywhere.So I decided to go with Eero. I purchased the three pack, even though that would seem overkill based upon what I read. I managed to get one Eero in one of the upstairs bedrooms, in line of sight (when doors aren’t closed) with the base Eero in the home office. Now the upstairs bedrooms get 100Mbps much of the time, but certainly above 75Mbps. Problem solved. The third Eero I put in the kitchen two rooms over from the living room. To my slight surprise, the Chromecast on my current TV connected to the Eero in the bedroom, directly above it. The living room now gets greater than 75 Mbps most of the time. Back in the kitchen and the adjoining dining room, I’m also getting in excess of 75Mbps. The back yard also benefits from the third Eero. Problem solved.I may still try Google wifi, if I can get my hands on it before my return period ends with Amazon for the Eero, but if not, at least I can now enjoy awesome wi-fi coverage, even if it did cost me a few bucks more. As for the Eero - the set up was a breeze. My Sonos plugged in to the kitchen Eero worked first time, and the Eero app has worked flawlessly. The only slight disappointment, apart from the price, is not having the option to not broadcast the SSID. Perhaps that capability will come in one of their frequent updates. Also, I can’t see what devices are connected to a particular Eero, by selecting that Eero in the app. Instead I have to go to each device separately to see which Eero it is connected to.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RC09XG5URI9HU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1Y8N13JD8MEWV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Byron Antillon",29-Jan-2017,2,"I was getting better speeds on my older Apple airport extreme","I placed one of the three eero's in my office and the speeds there are slow. I pay for a 300Mbps x 20Mbps connection and I'm seeing 42Mbps in my office (~10' away from the eero which is directly connected to my cable modem).  Perhaps I'm too close to the eero but I can't force my PC to connect to a further eero. In any case for the price I paid for this device I should see much faster speeds that 42Mbps. I was getting better speeds on my older Apple airport extreme. That said the interface on the app and the setup were quite simple, I really like the family profiles and based on that I rate this product a 2. But seriously $500 hardware to get such slow speeds is ridiculous.  Performance on the other two devices fluctuates greatly depending a several variables, so overall I'm not happy. I would probably try similar technology offered by several other competitors (Google On-Hub, Linksys Velop or Neatgear's Orbi) all in similar price points and Linksys does offer their tri-band technology which sounds promising! Do your research before you commit to eero.  They may have been first to market, but the competition is steep and getting better.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VWRT1X7ZXI2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1LV5BBLC9VSNY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Maui",28-Jan-2017,2,"FiOS/Sonos/AppleTV incompatibility – sending eero back","Lengthy note follows so I have divided it into 3 sections if you want to skip ahead: (1) the problems I had (1 star); (2) experience with eero Customer Support (4 stars); and (3) implications for other potential buyersThe ProblemsI don’t think I have anything unusually complicated but it is also not a simple set-up.  I have Verizon FiOS, which means we have a single unit for the modem/router.  This also, per the eero website, creates a distinctive wireless environment where the FiOS wireless network shouldn’t be turned off once eero is up and running.  Connected to the wifi network is a collection of devices – computers, cell phones, tablets; some smart thermostats (Nest and Ecobee) and, unfortunately for eero, two Sonos AMP boxes to play music in a couple of our rooms and an AppleTV device.I found the installation process initially stressful but ultimately straightforward and simple.  The initial stress was because after reading about the potential challenges with FiOS I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to figure out how to make it work.  Eero recommended putting the eero in “Bridge” mode and this differs from the step by step instructions they have available so I was concerned I would lose my way in the install.  However, it is very easy, which is what eero told me it would be.  It took about 15 minutes to get the three eero devices connected and functioning, and the mobile eero app was very easy to use.  After I got the eero’s up and running connecting the other devices to the eero network was also straightforward – nothing different than connecting to any other wifi network.  All the computers, iPads, thermostats etc. all found the network and connected without any apparent problems.  Importantly, the eero signal was strong throughout the house, which was the major issue I was trying to solve.However, it was a different story with Sonos and AppleTV. Mysteriously, one of the Sonos boxes would drop out of the eero network after initially being found, and one of the Sonos boxes worked perfectly.  If I rebooted the faulty Sonos box, right after the reset I would see it on the eero network but as soon as I tried to play music, it would drop off.  The AppleTV was similarly mysteriously faulty. I like to use the AppleTV to play music on our home sound system and the music is located on my iPhone.  Prior to eero, this was easy to do – AppleTV recognized my iPhone and the music (and other content) on the phone and would play it.  However, with eero, AppleTV didn’t find the phone.  Oddly, I can use my iPhone in “Airplay” mode to still play music via AppleTV.  In other words I could “push” music from my iPhone to AppleTV but I couldn’t “pull” music using AppleTV from the iPhone.  Figure that one out!Customer Service ExperienceThis experience was positive, despite neither of the problems being solved.  I used email exchanges to communicate with the eero folks – I wanted to make sure they had time to figure out my problem and suggest an appropriate fix and I wanted to be able to try the fix on my own time.  Eero would respond in hours to my emails and their responses were friendly, easy to read and understand and they were not condescending to me, given my lack of technical aptitude.  Alos, every email from eero includes the phone number and hours of operation in case I wanted to call and speak with someone live – how many times have we been to help websites and been unable to find a phone number!  I want to thank Raoul, Isaac, and Hayden for helping try to solve the problems.  However, nothing worked so I am going to pull out the eero network and send it back.Implications for othersReflecting on this situation, I think there are some generalizations to think about if you are considering purchasing eero.  The first is that everyone’s wifi situation is going to be unique and I am sure others are successfully using Sonos and AppleTV with eero. So my problems are mine, and may not be yours.  Second, eero won’t work in all instances.  There is obviously something going on between the eero network and some systems that reside on it.  This is important to think about because I would have thought the eero network was “dumb” – it would capture a wifi signal from a device and pass it on its way without any modification.  However, eero appears to be doing something to the information it picks up – it is trying to be “smart” - and this is where problems will arise.  As I dug deeper into the help section and the eero community blogs I found many instances where eero was interacting in odd ways with devices on the network.  Often the problem would be solved.  There were a number of instances where people had posted that after an eero software update what had been working stopped working.  This needs to be considered as well – because of the way eero has designed its system, it might make a change in the future (or someone like Sonos or Apple might make a change) and your system will go down again.  This is ultimately why I told eero to stop working on my problem – I decided that even if they fixed it (which is a big if) I didn’t want to run the risk that I would have to go through this all over again the next time they released an update.My brother is an engineer at Cisco (how is that for supposedly having an unfair advantage!) and he recommended I try an “access point” since I have Ethernet cable throughout my house. He recommended: TP-Link TL-WA901ND Wireless N450 3TER Access Point, 2.4Ghz 450Mbps, 802.11b/g/n, AP/Client/Bridge/Repeater, 3x 5dBi, Passive POE.  I am going to give these a try but reading the product name makes me nervous – I have no idea what any of this means!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CCQCWKC3H3WG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1FW7CHMD950HD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Troy W.",26-Jan-2017,5,"Premium product (and worth it)","Beautifully simple and effective. I'll admit the price tag gave me pause initially, but I was desperate for a solution to inconsistent WiFi throughout my home and constantly buffering Netflix and Hulu. We don't have cable, so streaming quality is important to us. The system came highly recommended by a friend who had similar issues, so I gave it a try. I had tried various routers and range extenders (wired and wireless) in the past, none of which seemed to work as advertised.First, and most importantly, the system works. It created a single, continuous network throughout my home. I don't have to switch networks when I'm on the patio or upstairs and my online and streaming experience is now what I expect it to be. We have phones, tablets, computers, printers, Sonos, Roku, etc. all connected to a single network and it works awesome.The packaging was clean and elegant. The setup could not have been more simple. The iPhone app is incredible. It allows me to monitor the network, see which devices are connected, test download and upload speeds, turn on/off guest access, and more.After several weeks, one of the units wasn't connecting to the network, so I called their support number. It was late on a Sunday evening and I was connected with a polite, English-speaking representative.

"Matt",26-Jan-2017,5,"As good as advertised!","I live in a condo complex where my unit has 3 levels, lots of walls and stairs, and about 25 other wireless signals from neighbors. Traditional wifi setup (of a modem/router combo unit on the first floor and a range extender on the second level) just wasn't working. And believe me, I have tried and tried. After years of frustration and spotty signal strength from other products, I decided to go top of the line and order eero (3 pack). Finally, my problems are solved.About 15 minutes after opening the box, eero was updated and broadcasting. I've never had a problem since. My ISP (Comcast unfortunately) provides 75Mbps; every speed test I've run with eero indicates 80+. The handoff of devices from one router to the next is equally impressive. The real kicker is the wall to wall coverage though; signal strength is routinely double that (160+), when before that I felt lucky to get 10.I've used many devices at once; a wired computer, wired DVR, wireless DVR, wireless laptop, two iPads, three smart phones. None of them have ever lost a signal.Expensive yes, but so worth it.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2V7JZAMLXEDCU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1DZE4Y3Q0YMK7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"Dee Sooner",26-Jan-2017,3,"Only modest improvement with one Eero","I have a 932 sq foot home with only one person using, so I purchased a single Eero, per the recommendation on Eero's website and reviews on Amazon.  My internet speed increase and reliability has been, in a word, ""meh.""  My Eero speed tests consistently report at least 5-8Mbps faster than my three other third-party tests report (Simple Speed, SpeedSpot, AT&T speed test), so I'm not sure what is true.  I have the following devices connected: Macbook, iPhone, Ring doorbell, Sonos, HP printer, Roku.  I have CenturyLink 20Mbps download internet access, which is probably average for people in my income range, neighborhood and usage.  I'm not sure a modest performance improvement was worth $200; while I haven't tested it, I may achieve just as much or more improvement upgrading to CenturyLink 40Mbps download.  I'm sure it is a fantastic device if one has a 2,000+ sq ft home with 2 stories and uses 2-3 Eeros; I have friends who love it.  But I have not experienced a material improvement for a smallish one-story home.In researching the Eero website, blog and support board, even a single Eero is claimed to outperform a home router, though Eero is certainly designed to work best as a system. Performance includes more than just speed - also includes buffering, reliability and reach. Overall, I saw only a small increase in overall performance of my home network with one Eero. Bottom line: if you have a home <1,000 sq feet, a cord-cutter who streams everything, and have only modest disposable income, you are not Eero's target market. Frankly, I'm not sure why Eero even encourages anyone to purchase just one Eero, as clearly it works best as a system of at least 2-3 Eeros to reach all areas of a bigger home. It is disappointing that Eero's customer support is blaming the customer - me - for my simply not understanding.  I will be returning.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SYN3YGFPK4PG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2HMG7E6K6KPYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

In the end they were returned for a refund.I have a large house (5000 sq ft over 2 floors) with a second pool house (1000 sq ft).  I have ethernet to may rooms so I wanted a system that used ethernet to communicate instead of WiFi and eero seemed like the perfect choice.  Set-up was simple using the app and adding the IP reservations and ports to forward was also simple.  The problem was that the eeros simply would not work as expected and kept dropping connections and, when they would connect, the speed was about 3 Mbps (I get ~120 Mbps from Comcast and via ethernet .  Tech support said it was most likely due to interference (both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands) and that all 6 of my eeros were 'thermal cycling' (slowing the speed to cool off when they got too hot).  I bought an Rf frequency monitor and verified there was no Rf interference on the 5 GHz band unless I was actively using the WiFi connection via a local eero.  They may work well for some, but they did not work for me.  I bought option #2 after returning the eeros (AmpliFi HD) and they have been working well for the last week or so (100+ Mbps via WiFi and no drop outs).  I don't think it was environmental interference that caused issues with the eeros given how well the AmpliFi's work.  I hope eero can solve the issues (or maybe my house is unique, but I doubt it).I was happy with the eero tech support.

"Joe Consumer",19-Jan-2017,5,"So much better than traditional extenders!","We were on the verge of buying another netgear extender for $100 until I heard a blurb on NPR from a reporter talking about ideal Christmas gifts.  The NPR reporter mentioned the eero as her ideal wish list item.  After a bit of research and understanding how eero technology is much more effective at extending wi-fi versus traditional extenders, I decided to purchase the eero two-pack for our two-story, 1,900 sqft home.  The result:  we now get steady wi-fi in our second story back office versus before we had a netgear extender which could not reach the office.  After a month of enjoying the two-pack eero, we got greedy and purchased a third eero unit to amp up wi-fi speed in the upstairs office.  The third unit is the cherry and we are super happy with being able to use our upstairs office instead of camping out in the living room close to the router.ALSO a side note - when deactivating the router function in our internet service provider's modem and activating the eero router function, I reached out to Spectrum/Time Warner for help. Big kudos to Spectrum/Time Warner for already having knowledge on how to redirect the router from the Spectrum modem to the eero device.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34WWPGVR6JUQH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3ZTQHJEBZAJ9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

They are incredibly easy to setup using the free mobile app.  They offer superb bandwidth via WiFi and seem to really do well at not dropping connections.  I have absolutely zero complaints so far.  As well, the range for each module is very impressive.  We can easily go 100 ft in any direction and have excellent signal.My one favorite feature about the EERO system compared to several other similar systems I was looking at, is that each module has two ethernet ports on that back that allow two things to be available: 1) I can hardwire devices at my office(that do not have wifi option) to these via ethernet cable, and 2) I can hardwire the modules via ethernet back to the main unit serving as the router which provides a more robust setup with a much less chance of dropouts.I will definitely recommend these to other for their small offices and homes.

The third one we place downstairs in the downstairs elbow connected wirelessly. This fixed our weak zone in the front, however our performance in the back yard has been disminished.

"Mike S",15-Jan-2017,2,"Good idea, performance issues, could be bad for gaming","---- Edit 2/20/2017 ----I will say eero Customer Service has been awesome.  But, after two replacement eeros I am still  having problems as outlined below.  I am at the point, I have disconnected the closest node to my laptop so I only connect to the gateway node to minimize drops.  I still have drops on the gateway node (via ping test described below) but not as frequent, though they seem to occur at bad times (e.g., watching a vid or playing a game).  Not sure what to do next.Also, today, I have and issue where the eero iPhone app displays that there is a internet connectivity issue and the Gateway eero is offline.  YET, I can still connect to the internet through the laptop and other devices [scratches head].  CS told me to reboot the eeros AGAIN to see if it fixes the problem  At this point, I am afraid to touch anything when things are working so I told them I would wait till there is a problem (I run a significant internet based home business) or I can afford to be down.I am still hoping things get worked out and stabilized a little more, but will probably picking up a backup router just in case. I will update this review again as things progress.----- Original Review ----Be careful if you game or periodic dropped connections will cause problems.  I have 3 of these and all of them are on one floor within 50' of each other.  After installing, I started constantly seeing internet lag and dropped connections.  My son, playing games, kept getting booted out of games because of the dropped connections.So, I decided to do a little Ping test.  The eero that was connected to the cable modem was x.x.x.1, and the eero that was in the family room was x.x.x.27.  My laptop was wireless connected to x.x.x.27.  By nature of the mesh network, my laptop path to the internet should simplistically be:Laptop ==> x.x.x.27 ==> x.x.x.1 ==> Cable Modem ==> InternetTo monitor the connection I opened a 3 DOS Command windows, with each window running one of the following ping commands:1) ping -t x.x.x.12) ping -t x.x.x.273) ping -t 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS Server [internet])The -t option keeps the ping test running constantly so I could monitor the connections.  It turns out the ping to x.x.x.27 stayed pretty steady, while the ping to x.x.x.1 kept timing out.  This led me to believe that the connectivity between x.x.x.27 and x.x.x.1 was the problem.  So I disconnected power from x.x.x.27 which forced my laptop to connecto to x.x.x.1... GUESS WHAT?The problem went away!I plugged the family room eero back in and the problem returned.  I switched eeros with the third (by the entry way) and the problem still existed.  I factory reset the eero and re-added back to the network and the problem still exists.So this leads me to believe there is a problem with their mesh implementation and/or possible interference rejection between the nodes.I NEVER had a dropped connection with my previous Linksys router. The only reason I replaced it was because I dropped it while rearranging the office and broke off the anntennae. I have some pretty good experience working with secure mesh networks and understand the benefits so I thought  I would give this commercial technology a try......IMHO, they will get there, but there is still several bugs and performance issues to be worked out.Note:Hopefully I explained the above simply enough for others to try the test and see what performance you are getting.  You can find the IP addresses to use in the eero app by clicking on nodes at the bottom of the My Network page.  Click the number next to Number of Devices on that page to get a list of all the devices connected to the network, look for the computer you are running the ping test on to see what eero your compter is connected to.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3449TY1FLFQUV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3RHV1Q2CIIIPR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Maggie Keegan Gross",14-Jan-2017,3,"It makes me sad to have to post such a mediocre review - ...","It makes me sad to have to post such a mediocre review - there are a lot of things Eero does well, and I really wanted to keep this product, but in the end it didn't work for my situation. In short, I just switched from Uverse to Spectrum, and as part of the change, I bought my own modem, the Arris Surfboard SB6183 (https://www.amazon.com/ARRIS-SURFboard-SB6183-DOCSIS-Cable/dp/B00MA5U1FW) based on the recommended supported modems from Spectrum and the excellent reviews on the Surfboard. Cable guy came and set me up, the modem worked perfectly and I was pulling down 117 mb/s on ethernet.I opened up the Eero and set up the primary -- set up was a piece of cake, you just download the app on your phone and follow the instructions. It was working within a couple minutes, and I was getting full speed over wifi standing right in front of the primary. I tested the speeds around our place (we have 1 level, 3 bedrooms) - in the furthest bedroom from the primary Eero I was getting about 33 mb/s. Not bad, considering that it was a deadzone with my previous setup. I plugged in the 2nd Eero in the hallway outside the furthest bedroom, and it found the primary and set up without a problem. Afterwards, I was getting about 77 mb/s down in that far bedroom. Pretty good!So I was happy, I moved all our wifi devices onto the network and figured I had solved internet in our place once and for all.Well, the next day I bought a new phone (big holiday week for tech!). I brought my phone home and restored from my computer backup and started downloading all my apps from the Apple app store. Only... some of them weren't downloading. I figured it was some kind of bottleneck due to the large number of apps I was downloading at the same time, and let it go for the evening. The next morning, about half of my apps were done, and the other half were just missing. Hmm. So I jumped onto the App Store and started downloading the missing apps one by one. And here's when I noticed the problem. Some of them downloaded without a problem, but some of them just would not finish! It would start, get about 30%, or 50%, or 75% done downloading, and then I would get a dialog that said ""This app cannot be downloaded at this time. Retry/Cancel?"" And I would retry, and it would start downloading, and I would get the same dialog. Over and over. Now, the part that made it really frustrating was that sometimes.. if you persisted long enough.. it would actually finish. And so I spent the next 3 days, tip tapping away at this dialog, retry, retry, retry, hoping to finish all my app downloads.Was it the new ISP? Was it the new modem? Was it the new Eero? Was it the App Store? Unfortunately I had so many variables, I wasn't sure where to start or who to call first. So I tried another network. I turned off Wifi and tried downloading the trouble apps on LTE - and they downloaded instantly. Ok - so it was network.I jumped on my computer, also connected to the network, and tried downloading some apps directly from iTunes. Similar situation -- apps would start downloading, and then I would get ""Error 3253"", which is a generic ""download interrupted, check your network connection"" type error.So it was the network, and it was specifically the Apple stores that I was having a problem with. No issues with any other source of content - Netflix, Hulu, all my streaming media was working just fine. I spent a lot of time googling the issue, and couldn't find anything specifically resembling my symptoms - I did see that there were some reported problems between the Arris SB6183 modem and the Eeros, when the Arris had a specific version of firmware. However, my Arris did not have that firmware version. My Arris is on D30CM-OSPREY-1.5.2.3-GA-01-NOSH, where the problem firmware was SB6183-9.2.0.0-GA-03-29-NOSH.So next step was to switch out the Eero and then the modem, and see what specifically was causing the issue. I started with the Eero - I bought a new router, the TP-Link Archer C7 (v2) as recommended by Wirecutter. Unplugged Eero, setup of the Archer (which is a hideous black thing with 3 antennas and a real light show of green LEDs that CANNOT  be turned off). Set up was easy, I spun up a wifi network and tried downloading one of the troublesome apps -- and it downloaded with no problem, and very quickly. I tried a few more apps, on my phone and my computer, and everything downloaded quickly without issue. Sigh. So it was the Eeros.I tested the speed of the Archer around my place to see if maybe I wanted to hook up the Eeros in bridge mode alongside the Archer. In the furthest bedroom, where I was getting 77 mb/s before with the Eeros, I was able to get 100 mb/s with the Archer. Wow. I guess those hideous antennas are doing something right. Sigh again. So I didn't need the Eeros at all, our place was small enough (around 1300 sq ft) that the 1 Archer was able to handle the job.So, I packed up the Eeros and sent them back today. As I said, I was very sad to do so -- the Eeros are aesthetically lovely, and the app is too. I hate looking at the Archer, and I need to buy some black tape to cover up the laser show of LEDs. But for whatever reason, the Eeros just weren't working with the largest content provider in my life, and thats a deal breaker.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TG9TY96RSSPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1Q68NL64H7QO1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Mary Ventura",13-Jan-2017,5,"No More Resetting Signal!!!","5 years ago I moved from a 1300 sqft home to a 3300 sqft home. And for 5 years I have struggled to get consistent, high quality coverage throughout our space.I have spent at least $300 in modems, wifi routers and extenders, not to mention hours...sometimes the better part of an entire day setting a network up, only to find equipment isn't compatible and I need to start over.We had made due with one extender that needed to be reset about 3x week.When I heard about Eero I was excited, maybe my evenings of crawling out of bed in the middle of a show to reset the signal were over.They ARE!!! Eero is as amazing as I heard it was!!!I set the whole system (I bought the 3 pack) up in about 30 minutes- that includes time spent reading the instructions.We have a network, a personalized password that makes sense...not the weird random series of characters everyone hates but beginners don't know how to change...(For reference, I don't consider myself a beginner in this work, I am tech savvy and able to work my way through networks and systems, however setting up multiple different extenders on one network proved difficult for me. We had personalized network password before eero).I can control everything from my phone...not much to control but I can see how many devices are on the signal, turn the device lights off/on, and see the speeds I'm uploading/downloading at.Also, the diagram says to centralize all the hubs, but due to the odd layout of our house it just wasn't possible. Even without the centralizing we have full signal in every room, including our garages and backyard. We basically cover 1/2 an acre!!! It's not full strength all over, but it's covers the space!We have been up and running solidly for a month now...no issues!The CONS-*I know I should list $$$, however I think the quality of the devices compared to the cost I've spent trying to get what this delivers is fairly comparable...I'd much rather spend the money once on one functional product than little bits at a time trying to make something work that just doesn't ever get there.*Ethernet outlets are limited.

Can't shoot it up the stairs as stairs have a landing and a 180 degree bend.

"mike w",08-Jan-2017,4,"Great upgrade in signal strength and WiFi speeds!","We have an older, 3000 sq ft house and had dead zones and performance problems with my old Airport Extreme router.  Decided to take the plung to this one for better coverage (I also wanted to reach our outdoor kitchen area where we sometimes set up a Fire TV stick and projector to watch a movie).  I'm not sure if it is the bump to AC or the mesh network, but the 3 eero devices have been amazing. Looking forward to being able to turn off my kid's wifi via Echo as well.I would give it 5 stars, except for 2 minor things:1. Manual parental controls are great (scheduling no internet times, turning off internet on demand), but I'd love for more granular control in the form of a couple of new features. First, some basic content filtering.  My kids are getting older, and I'd love some simple filtering to prevent them from getting to known bad sites. Second, maybe allow time limits (not time of day, but limiting active internet use to 2 hours, for example). This would be harder, because iPads / iPhones are always in the background doing something on the network, so determining ""active"" usage could be challenging.2. I cannot seem to get the port forwarding working. I have a Synology NAS running a web server with a wordpress blog, and I cannot seem to get it to allow the connection through.  Need to follow up with support, but the WiFi has been so great, I actually am OK with my web server being inaccessible in the meantime!Edit: I just got a response from eero support about the port forwarding.  So it seems that the port forwarding is working fine, but the eero does not support hairpin NAT / NAT loopback, which means I can't access my internal servers through the external domain / IP.  Not a huge issue, since internally I can simply access the server via my internal IP.  When I access my domain on any other network, it works fine. So, while it's still not fully resolved, they did get back to me in 2 days and provided an answer to why I though it wasn't working.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMP9CPPF29Z7H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3MH22GBU0JWHK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"RB",06-Jan-2017,2,"Setup process was too high of a security risk for me","This review is not for the eero’s wifi connection and performance, but for the setup requirements. I did not fully install the product because of privacy issues.I had read that there was an app involved in setting up the eero, but I didn't realize the amount of information that is shared via the app (as in, everything, I think). It was way too much of an invasion of my privacy, let alone the thought of someone hacking into eero’s data files and getting into any data remnants from this setup procedure.The information they initially required was:• Name• Email address• Mobile number (to send a verification code to the mobile number. Sorry, but why can’t they email it?)I grudgingly plugged in the above data (I really, really resent having to create an account for any app or product). Once the eero app found and registered the eero (which, kudos to them, took under 2 minutes), they then wanted to know:• Network name• PasswordHuh? Wha? They want me to type in my wireless account’s password into their unknown app? Are you kidding me?This was the point at which the cute little eero was boxed back up and shipped back. Sorry eero, ease of use does not mean giving up privacy in this household.(This review was going to be a single star, but since the packaging was as good as any of Apple's, and the setup process as far as it went was pain-free, I am guessing they have done a good job on the rest of their product.)","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3G6JRC5TUD2D1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2XLJ12AG4LYTH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"K.F.",04-Jan-2017,5,"Would definitely recommend","Despite a few hiccups, the system has been great.My setup: I have a ~1400 sq ft, 2 story home. I bought 2 eeros so that I could place one downstairs (with my modem) and one upstairs where I used to have issues with connectivity. Prior to purchasing the eero system I had a tplink router and a tplink wifi extender plugged in upstairs. This worked in some cases but I had issues with devices dropping the network and even one device that would/could not connect to the wifi at all. My home has a second floor hallway which is open to the first floor.Pros: I am getting faster internet. Devices are no longer dropping off the network. All my devices can now connect. The eero looks sleek and the app is pretty easy to use.Cons: The system seems to be a bit finicky when it comes to placement of the eeros. It said to have the eero at person level but the only way I could get the upstairs eero to connect was to move the downstairs eero up onto a ~8 ft high shelf. Now, the two eeros have line of sight without any walls but it was still a little bit of a dance to get them to ""see"" each other. Maybe once you have them connected you can move them more easily. I don't have a need to since it works as is, but it wasn't as straight forward a process as I had hoped. Enough to make it not worth it? No. Enough to mention? I think so. Also I messed up connecting an ethernet switch, but once I explained my problem, it was updated on the help site. All in all, I think highly of the company and the product.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6RWEH6Z8BKF6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A7AGJDVF8S196/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

All my devices have stable connections - the eero app makes administration super simple.

"DALJONES",03-Jan-2017,5,"Saved my kidney and my firstborn!","I rarely write reviews, but this has proven worthy of my efforts.  On many occasions over the past 10 years, my wifi network has caused me to seriously contemplate liquidating all of my assets and spending my remaining years tracking down the evil geniuses who created them.  I'm not particularly computer savvy, but I've always been able to follow online instructions to do port forwarding or create static ip's and the like.  This however has always been a trap, one that leads me to believe I can manage my wifi network and make it......actually work (imagine that).  After several different routers, a couple of range extenders and countless hours I would have rather been doing anything else, I finally gave up!  Following much research, I took the plunge and paid full price (gulp) for a 3 pack of the Eero's.  This has all been done with Time Warner Cable (if that matters).The Pros:1. It took me about 20 minutes to setup the network w/3 Eero's....easily the simplest setup I've ever done!2. My 2,000 sq. ft. 2 story house and my attached 1,000 sq. ft garage all have very strong wifi.3. I can nickname my devices so it's easy for me to see what's on the network.4. I easily grouped devices together that my kids use and set times they can't access wifi.5. I can access my network to pause/un-pause wifi for specific devices or for everything, even when I'm not home (using the iphone app).6. I've had it setup for about a week and it's been flawless!  All my speed tests in every area of the house are at my providers max capacity!7. I had a question about setting up the app for me and my wife.  I called in and was told they were experiencing high call volumes, but someone answered about 10 seconds later and quickly helped me get things done.8. The iPhone app interface is very easy to use....and it all makes sense.  They've simplified it to be used by actual human beings....ones that don't work on computers for a living.  An example:  I wanted to do some port forwarding....all I had to do was forward the port AND the app actually suggested that I make a static IP so I don't lose the port forwarding if the device doesn't connect to that ip in the future!  I always had to learn that the hard way.  Eero's then took me right to the screen to set the static ip!9. It actually works...everywhere...all the time...imagine that!Cons:1. Somewhat spendy.  However, it's much cheaper than a kidney, or my firstborn....which is what I was contemplating trading to anyone who could solve my wifi dilemmas.I'll update this review in the future if my Eero's turns on me, betrays my trust, or does anything else you should be warned about.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RP19IWS2JGXGF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A370IJ33B19Q76/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Kirk Strauser",03-Jan-2017,5,"I'm never building another router","I'm not going to detail my geek cred, but suffice it to say for these purposes that I usually build my own Linux-based routers. I'm not allergic to solder or compiling kernels. But I bought a 3-unit eero system over Thanksgiving and it's been a godsend.These networks aren't so much hubs as layer 2 switches. Know how your phone jumps from one station to another as you move through the house? How it's automatic and quick, but sometimes totally breaks the connection and makes Netflix stutter or VOIP calls drop? eero totally ends that. Connections are rock solid even as they bounce from one router to another. And they do bounce. If my kid and I are sitting on the couch using our phones, and both of us start streaming videos, eero is smart enough to push one of us off onto a different router so we're not interfering with each other's connection.I would not willingly go back to a handbuilt network now. I've only had a mesh network for a month and a half, but it's so much better than anything I'd pieced together myself that I'm retiring from the practice.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11EIEP4EOOA8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1QABB1MG53NYM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Robert",01-Jan-2017,4,"Outstanding wifi with capabilities my old network never had.","I am not tech savy, and have always been dependent on a local IT guy to set up and maintain my wifi network. All those router settings are like a foreign language to me. Our house is old, 4,000-plus square feet, single level, and made of brick with many interior brick walls. Our old wifi system required 4 routers, and we still had a few areas in the house with very poor signal. Each of the routers was connected to our main ATT Uverse router by ethernet cables.Eero setup is simplicity in itself. The eero app walks you right through it. I did encounter a glitch during setup, however, and this was related to my main router. Our internet service is through ATT Uverse. The ATT Uverse router must be put in bridge mode, or the eero system will not function properly. I spent a frustrating hour or so until I found this bit of information in the online help section. I wish eero had presented this information more prominently in the set up guide; this is why I took one star off my rating. Anyway, after a simple phone call to ATT (go directly to a service operator; don't try to use their automated menu system), I requested that they put my router in bridge mode, which they did remotely while I was speaking with the operator. After that, the eero system has worked flawlessly.I still needed 4 eero units to cover the house, the same number of routers as I had before; and all of the eeros are connected to the main router by ethernet cables as before. But now download speeds are better than I ever had, and every square inch of the house receives great signal, whereas before, there were parts of the house that had very low signal. Before, I was constantly having to reset my routers; I have had my eero system now for 2 months, and I have not had to reset any of the routers once. On my old network, I often had to manually change the wifi address settings on my device as I moved from one router zone to another; with the eero mesh network I no longer have that problem; and for the first time if my iPhone is in the bedroom, for instance, my Apple watch stays connected to it from anywhere in the house. Being able to monitor the status of my eero network through the app, which you can do from anywhere that you have access to the internet, is very cool. And I really love the independence I now have--I, a guy who never had any understanding of setting up a wifi network--of being able to set up and maintain my own wifi network.I cannot vouch for how well eero works using wireless connectivity between the routers, since all of mine are wired directly to my main ATT Uverse router via ethernet cables. I hope this review helps in the decision making process for any of you who are in a situation similar to mine.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DT4D77N3SW8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1H9IBG8R4WEG9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

I can now get 400+ Mbit/s all over my home, whereas before I'd be lucky to break 100. Pros:* Ethernet jack on every device. Unlike some of the competitors, this means  you can choose to hard wire some of the eeros for even better speeds (I used a MoCA bridge for this, which runs Ethernet over the existing cable connections in my house). Some of the competitors only have an Ethernet jack on a ""main"" device.* Simple setup.* Reliable network that Just Works. My phone automatically connects to the best network to maximize speed.* Can be used in ""bridge"" mode where the Eero's just acts as access points to my existing router. There are  a few downsides:* Need to make an account to set up the Eero in the app.* Needs an app at all. I have an iPhone right now, but I've previously used windows phone and might go back to it in the future and the fact that you need either an Android or iOS phone to do the setup is a bit worrying. I'd prefer if the ""app"" was just a web page served by the devices, so it could be accessed on any device, including a laptop.* No full IPv6 support. Not super critical right now I suppose, but a bit risky that it may not support this for the future (no problem if you use the Eero's in bridge mode though - as long as your existing router handles IPv6). This is the one and only reason I kept my existing router rather than just use Eero's for everything.For me personally it would be a 5 star review if the IPv6 thing gets addressed in a future update because it would mean I could just get rid of my traditional router altogether. The other cons are an annoyance but not enough to dock a star.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15M2W93ANZRJ1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AWHUHA7KB8FWR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Biff Henderson",29-Dec-2016,1,"Didn't work well for me. YMMV","I will admit that I'm in the minority of reviewers here, but this system just didn't work out for me and I'm rather underwhelmed at the product support.I had been running a home system with an apple extreme and a couple of airport expresses connected via LAN for extending the wifi network in my house (2-story, fairly large). Had worked very well ,with the sole exception that when moving around the house using wifi, the various base stations wouldn't hand off very efficiently, holding on to a weak signal even when a stronger one was available (had to switch wifi on a device off and back on to get the better signal). A minor inconvenience, but otherwise fairly robust setup. I run three media servers and  Sonos system in which most of the units are on the LAN but do have a couple on the Sonos wireless net. Worked pretty flawlessly with the above exception.In any event, the idea of a true mesh network sounded like the solution to my roaming issues. My concern with a system like the Eero was the cloud-based nature of the system, lack of diagnostic tools at my disposal to help solve problems, and the phone/tablet-app-only interface. So I threw the dice. Set up was fairly straight forward with the iPhone app. The problem I had from the start, however, was intermittent short drop outs of internet service and connections to my network servers. I'm talking about 5-10 second intervals where streaming would stop, Skype calls drop, loss of connection to my music library (on a NAS), about several times an hour. Worse, after the first few days, the app on my iPhone couldn't even connect with the Eero system, yet that system remained connected to the internet and continued to route signals (with the above problems). Unfortunately, this was just before Christmas and I figured tech support would be sparse so I waited 'til just after Christmas to call. Got level one support which was fairly useless (""never heard of that problem before""), was kicked up to level 2, but that entailed waiting for an email response. 24 hours later, heard back from tech support acknowledging the ticket and letting me know they would get back to me ""in a few days"" when they had some sort of answer.This left me high and dry so I swapped out the system for my old setup and am back up and running just great with my previous set-up.Now, I'm willing to admit that my network my be atypical with multiple media servers, a Sonos system, reserved IP addresses, etc., but the lack of ability to interface with the router in any meaningful way, and, in my experience at least, marginal customer support, to be suboptimal for a product of this nature in this price range. I'm fairly tech-savvy so usually can solve problems without the need for tech support, but with a system like this, you're kind of stuck.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NRL5TCPRJFYP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1I1MTEDPQKTCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

The Eero WiFi System is simple to install, I think I was up and running within 20-30 minutes.  The most amazing thing is my speed test for the Smart TV increased 5 times (Download Speed) which means I no longer have annoying buffering while while watching Grand Tour or, House of Cards - Can't have that.  I have recommended this product to people at work who have claimed similar increases in their WiFi performance.  I totally recommend this product!!  The price for this through Amazon is the same at Best Buy.  I much rather buy through Amazon because my purchases here benefits Omni Nano.NOTE: Eero recommends getting a twin pack for homes and apartments which are less than 2,000 square feet in area.  My 2-Story Townhome with 1,800 square feet is well covered by the this system.

"WolfX5",26-Dec-2016,5,"Great product but be aware of some SERIOUS PRIVACY ISSUES WITH USING EERO...","First let me say that this product works well and have solved a very difficult wifi coverage issue for my business.  I am getting my full 50MB download speed at the Eero connected to my router and about 30 - 40MB on average around the office, sometimes in places where I got literally ZERO connection before Eero, so I'm pleased with it's performance. What I'm NOT pleased about is the invasion of privacy that Eero products seem to come bundled with. In essence, because you MUST use the Eero app to set up the network, and that software ONLY comes as an Android phone or Iphone app (IOS on Ipad is NOT supported!), you are basically FORCED to give Eero a working cellular phone number linked to your account. Also, because Google enforces cell phone authentication now when you download Android apps, if you use Eero's Android app and you've never given Google your actual cell phone number you will have to do that too just to get the Eero app loaded on your phone. Ridiculous. No doubt both Eero and Google could use your cellular number to tie every bit of your web traffic to the owner of the cellular phone if they so choose which doesn't bode well for privacy advocates. There also doesn't appear to be a way for Eero to enforce MAC authentication so if you're used to using specific MAC addresses to limit what devices can connect to your router you are out of luck. Anyone who can sniff your wifi traffic and decrypt it will have full access to your network. I frankly think it is entirely disrespectful of a company to force you into this situation and if it wasn't for the absolute necessity of having Wifi coverage using Eero I would have chosen another vendor because of these privacy concerns.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FICHRSDH8HZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1SM3YUTM0C135/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"J. L. Coddington",26-Dec-2016,5,"Router Nirvana","Before eero, one of our computers would disconnect from WiFi frequently and we had occasional buffering issues with Netflix and Amazon Video on our smart televisions. I should also mention that In the last couple of years we've added two tablets, an Amazon Echo, an Echo Dot, a device that monitors our rooftop solar panels, a Joule sous vide, a Hue bridge and several WiFi-enabled LED light bulbs. Projecting that there will be more smart devices to come in the near future, we needed to act. After researching routers and router extenders, it was decided that the eero system would be our best option. A hefty price break sealed the deal and we purchased a three pack. Since the eero system was put into service to blanket the house, we've had no further connectivity issues. Installation was incredibly simple--all devices connected easily and they work as they are supposed to. As non-techies, automatic updates are a big plus; there is no wondering if our router is up-to-date (if it wasn't, we wouldn't have known how to update it anyway). Unlike our previous routers, eero's appearance is sleek and unobtrusive. We like our eero system so much that we will be ordering another one or two for our vacation home shortly.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2G9OMEADO9ZM4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AEN53KFZD8RYF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

Setting up several units took less than 20 minutes.  When choosing eero, this was one of the factors that influenced my decision over Netgear's product in which the app appeared dated (at least at the time I'm writing this).Most importantly though is that eero just works.  I struggled with random dead spots all over my home (despite having repeaters literally 15 ft from the devices) and I am no longer having this issue.While certainly more expensive than many products, the product does what it's supposed to do and delivers coverage all over my house.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1X37IGF6T3BV9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AOOI9XQ4E1S93/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Jeff",25-Dec-2016,1,"Great Product - Sub Par Support","Two parts to this review.First part is the hardware. Hardware is beautiful looking, super easy to set up, performance is awesome for my home, and the attention to detail of the product is spectacular. You are purchasing a system of routers that will completely cover your home in reliable wifi coverage. It looks like a modern ""apple designed"" device and has a beautiful app that is iOS and android friendly. No support for a computer to set up and monitor the system though that's not a huge deal.Second part is the support of the purchase of the product. Support of this item lacks common sense. You might never know when to purchase this item. Buy it now. You might loose out on a promotion. Also the experience I received when asking for assistance. Here is the story about the experience with Eero and Amazon Customer Service. I bought this as a early adopter of the ""mesh network"" items full price 500 bucks. It went on promotion 2 days after receiving it. Called eero and was told that I needed to talk to the seller. Called Amazon and uncovered there is No Policy or support to give me the difference while keeping the product. Instead they told me to re-purchase to get the promo price, THIS IS Amazon Customer Service's solution...To have over 1k in charges until the other was returned for Realiable Wi-Fi.

I was advised that I needed to wait to buy it again. They mentioned that if I would have bought a TV they could have helped me. So to recap. Bought the $500 3 pack. Had to return it. Lost money as I had to pay to return it. Tried to get the promotion again and it was off promo.

"Retired Engr",24-Dec-2016,5,"The 3 devices come well packaged and appear to be robustly built with a good quality finish","I have a 3 story condo and my wi fi wasn't reaching from the bottom to top floor.  I had tried a range extender and, while it allowed me to get an adequate signal where I added the extender, there were still a number of weak spots plus my devices wouldn't always change networks properly.  I read all the reviews on the eero system and finally decided to give it a try.  Most of the reviews I read have already hit the high points.  The 3 devices come well packaged and appear to be robustly built with a good quality finish.  I didn't have any issues setting up the devices using my iPhone; I was up and running in less than 30 minutes.  My signal strength/download rates were improved significantly throughout the house and now there is no need to switch networks since the mesh approach makes the devices look like one network.  After installation, I wanted to move one of the devices for improved coverage; so sent a test to eeros to make sure I knew how.  The response came shortly and it turned out you just unplug the device from its current location and plug it in in the new location; everything synchs up automatically.  I've been running for a couple of months now and everything is still working great.  I definitely would recommend this product.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2THS4ORM7XNO2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1NIU2SLK53ZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

This is closest system to approximating distributed wired APs performance-wise that I have found. Unlike mesh systems that use store and forward, there is no hop speed reduction or added latency. It just works! This is my go-to solution now for setting up whole-home wifi systems for clients that want to use their gadgets all over their (usually larger) homes. There's very little in the way of customization that IT geeks like myself might appreciate, but for the vast majority of folks that just want reliable wi-fi, this is the answer.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1N1AMUFWT2MQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2546ZHOWN3S8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"N.T.",22-Dec-2016,5,"After years of struggles, finally a solution that works BRILLIANTLY.","As the tech guy in my family, I have spent many, many years being the recipient of nonstop complaints about how bad the internet is in the apartment my parents live in. They have an account with Comcast and are signed up for the 150MB/s service. With the Motorola box provided from Comcast, even in non-peak hours, the fastest speeds I could get were about 40-60 MB/s download. Now, the real struggle begins when you take into consideration the layout of the apartment. When the apartment was designed in the 80s, the designer decided it would be a nice idea to put mirrors on almost every wall in the apartment. As many of you may know, a mirror will absolutely obliterate a Wi-Fi signal - now imagine a 4,000-square foot apartment full of mirrored walls... Needless to say I've had my hands full on every visit to them. I’ve tried EVERY solution in the books and up until now nothing has worked. It’s been a nightmare.Then comes along Eero... Let me say - what a LIFE CHANGER. First off, putting the Comcast modem / router combo device into bridged mode and setting up that first Eero box literally DOUBLED the wireless speed. My speedtest results went from the above mentioned to a consistent 110-130 MB/s. HUGE improvement. And then I proceeded to install the other 2 Eero units in a couple key locations across the apartment and the results are astonishing. In my mother's workspace, the wireless speeds were about 5-10 MB/s and the signal would quite often drop completely interrupting downloads and whatever else with the old setup. After getting the Eero system set up, she was getting a consistent 90MB/s download with not even a hint of instability. That’s over 90 linear feet from the main Eero box through 2 fully mirrored walls… I mean, what is this wizardry?I will say that this solution is expensive, and certainly not for everyone. But if you have any of the unusual issues that prevent traditional Wi-Fi setups like I have had, you literally don’t have to look elsewhere. Eero is a game changer, and has literally revolutionized my parent’s existence. My hat is off to the team behind this product. Bravo.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CXUJMEPBYS74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A278OU34A3CR19/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Kishore",17-Dec-2016,3,"I would say NOTHING exists that is perfect at this time","review 12/17/16Eero with three access points function at least as well as three separate access points (any brand) on the same SSID.  I wired all three of my eero units to wifi in order to handle the ""backhaul"".The fundamental problem with this setup:  Apple devices such as iphone 6s and the late 2016 macbook pro with touch bar (absolute latest devices available from Apple) do not handoff from one eero to another without dropping connection.  The handoff from access point to access point varies from 1 to 10 seconds depending who knows what.  You WILL DROP VOIP CALLS or IPHONE/IMUSIC/AIRPLAY streams during handoff.  It is NOT ANY different in performance compared to having multiple airport express access points.If all you want is more broad coverage of wifi, any number of solutions will be feasible. If you want SEAMLESS transition, I would say NOTHING exists that is perfect at this time.Apple has no way of knowing how many access points you have and it clearly does not scan or actively trade access points until your bandwidth drops into oblivion and you lose connection first.  Even then, the handoff is way too slow to reconnect.It is possible in addition that the foam insulation in my house is causing more radio reflections and slowing things down even further.  But that makes my point even more important:  the challenging house is where you would want an eero to work... and that's exactly where it won't.People seem to have reported poor results in other wifi discussions with apple products in terms of handoff between access points.  Unless devices are actively scanning with a second wifi antenna and pre-connecting, you won't get the desired results.  Another option might be if a device was connected to two signals at once.I am going back to me centrally placed asus router so that I can do Iphone over wifi with AT&T since my cell reception sucks in my house.  I lose some phone coverage at certain corners of my house, but this is something I am going to have to live with.  I suspect nothing important will change in my house until wifi technology moves towards a true mesh network at some point.SEAMLESS HANDOFF is what we are looking for Eero and Apple.  Eero is falsely advertising until this can be done.  Eero bears responsibility for not warning the average user that their product won't work with all clients.  I am clearly not the average user and so I was able to figure out that this is not going to work no matter how much I screw around with it.I gave this 3 stars but I should have been much more harsh for wasting half my day on this nonsense.  I am curious how many people who installed an Eero are predominantly just on one AP and therefore are reporting good results.  If someone has any further theories, I am willing to hear them...","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MBWZ1SZQAZK7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A168PA619DSF8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"David M. Benedict",15-Dec-2016,3,"Good coverage but be prepared for minor ""outages""","*** UPDATE ***Since I wrote this review, v2.10 came out and this seems to have fixed the disconnect issues I was having.===============================So far I love the reach this WiFi has.  The setup is extremely easy and can be done via an app.  Speeds are good. The router actually runs tests every now and then on its own (I think upon first boot up and once every 3-5 days or so).  I am using it in bridge mode to my Cisco 325RV so l can't try out the family management features or address assignment.  It is very tempting so that I can cut my tween off to get her attention. :)Now for the bad part.  It often seems I am getting disconnected.  My unprofessional guess is this is when the router is trying to push you over to the 5ghz band and it disconnects the device from 2.4ghz to try to achieve this.  If you are looking to be able to select what radio channel you are out of luck (for now at least.. Maybe that will change).  There is also no way to reboot the router (which almost seems mandatory after an internet outage).  I have submitted this as a feature request for the app.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3D8PVJFIXDTXC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A305MLAXZ2HU2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

I thoroughly changed my mind several times but never felt completely decided.  I liked Eero from the start, but was put off by the price.  Would have gone with Google Wifi but the performance didn't measure up.  Amplifi was an early pick but ultimately the unsightly style of the remote antenna turned me away.  And despite Orbi's superior speed, those things are HUGE to leave sitting out on the table.  Ultimately I was sold by Eero's amazing commitment to service, support, and features.  The latest 2.0 firmware upgrade has seen significant performance improvements.We have a central column in the middle of our townhouse with plumbing, AC, walls, etc. that notoriously blocked the central upstairs' wifi signal to much of the downstairs.  Where we did get signal it was degraded and slow.  Out of the box last night I had the first device up and connected via the app in under 10 minutes.

I'm in a house from 1924, and it was built in sections, meaning some of the interior walls were once thick exterior walls.  However, my apple extreme with apple express satellites had no trouble sharing signals through them.  The reason I wanted to try eero was not poor signal strength, but erratic performance with the Apple.  The guidelines for setting up the eero stations - 40 feet maximum with line of sight and no walls between - seem absurd to me.  In one case, I had the satellite 16 feet away, within line of sight, and it still came back with ""poor connection,"" which keeps you from moving forward in the setup process at all.To get the satellite stations on line, I've moved them close enough, and though it seems they're not far enough out to reach my target spots for better wifi, I ran speed test this morning and eero is out-performing Apple Extreme by a wide margin.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OETWO8QR4KLC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3SBUMI1XB19Y4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

I live in a 2nd floor one bedroom apartment and my boyfriend lives in another one bedroom on the first floor in the same complex.  There is a big 3 bedroom townhouse style apartment in between them.  Previously I had the newest Apple Airport Extreme in my place and we had an Apple Airport Express in his to repeat my connection.  His internet was always pretty weak and unreliable (he confessed just how bad only after we installed the eero).  After doing some research into mesh network router systems and seeing the great reviews for the eero system (and the fact that it was $100 off the usual price) I decided to give it a try.  I got the pack of 3 expecting to have the main one in my place right up against the wall and the 2nd and 3rd in his place to cover the whole apartment.Initial setup of the first unit with the eero iPhone app was a breeze.  The app also found the second but said the connection was too weak after several attempts.  I was bummed so I told the app to stop trying at which point it said there was an update available for the main unit.  After the update I tried to connect to the 2nd again and it worked.  Then the app ran the update for the 2nd.  Those 2 alone were all we needed to COMPLETELY blanket his apartment (back to the farthest corner) and mine.  I setup the 3rd (and let run the update) just because we had it.The app provides so much great information and is super easy to use.  This is a system I fully expect to keep for many many years as it can grow and adjust to whatever living situation we find ourselves in.Only negative I can say is that the USB port on the eero can't yet be used to connect an external hard drive for file sharing so for now my Airport Extreme is continuing to do that job on my network after adjusting it's settings to be in Bridge Mode only.  It's an extra annoying piece of tech that I hope I can retire in the coming months if eero adds that functionality via an update.I highly recommend the eero Home WiFi System.  Depending on your home situation you might even want to start with only one or two and see how well they cover the area before adding more.  The flexibility, reliability, coverage, and ease of use make this the very BEST WiFi system I have ever owned (and I've had just about every router Apple released).","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYFEJVQGRVTJ1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1UDDNFQ2N8MVZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Jim Ratliff",03-Dec-2016,5,"Solved my Nest cameras going offline problem","I had previously constructed a distributed Wi-Fi network throughout my 1920s house (with plaster-and-lath walls) using an Apple Airport, extended by an Airport Express (further extended using MoCA technology), but it still didn't adequately reach my pair of Nest cameras in two rooms downstairs. (My Airport Extreme was upstairs and the MoCA-fed Airport Express was downstairs but in a different room than either of the Nest cameras.)So I decided to jump to eero technology, and I'm happy I did. (I picked eero over Luma in part because eero was able to take advantage of rooms with an Ethernet feed and so could also take advantage of my MoCA.)The most-important benefit to me has been rock-solid connections for my two Nest cameras.Given that it looks like Apple might be retiring its Airport lines, this seems like a prescient transition for me (and also absolves this Apple loyalist of any guilt from moving away from Apple's Wi-Fi ecosystem). 😉","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7R9D8BUDZGZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A17X1FE00SH0ES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"SPMc",03-Dec-2016,3,"Product has potential but lacking some basic configuration settings","I so much wanted this solution to providing a seamless Wi-Fi network to work but despite some good features it needs some improvement and updates for me to rate it more than 3 stars.  As so many reviewers have stated the set up was very quick and easy. I had 2 of the 3 units up in less than 30 minutes and that included the time for software updates that came down immediately.  Signal strength was very good and I did not have any issues with any devices (iPad, 2 laptops, 2 Galaxy S6 phones) connecting but was only on the 2.4 GHz network.  All these devices connect to my original hardware on the 5 GHz band so with eero I was connecting at half the speed.  Upon further investigation using wifi analyzer I found I was on a busy channel from overlapping neighbors.  I could not find any settings in the phone app interface to alter the configuration so called tech support.  I was told unfortunately there is no option at this time to manually set or change the channel selection. Tech support told me this might be future update as many other callers have asked for it.  Also you cannot configure the units to only use the 5 GHz band nor can you turn off the SSID broadcast.  For me these are some basic settings present in most Wi-Fi routers so I was very disappointed by lacking in this current release of the product.In summary this product might be fine solution for many users in most environments, but the following shortcomings are why I am returning the product.• Product needs to be able to view/edit via a web interface, not just using a phone app.• Need to be able to configure to turn on/off 2.4 GHz or 5GHz network speed• Set channel frequency band• Use MAC authentication• Turn off SSID broadcast","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10D7JZZ0492HF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AVBR6DCV73GMD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"QK Shopper",03-Dec-2016,5,"Simply Fantastic. Have better coverage all through my sprawling ranch home than I've had through years of different ""solutions""","I am 1 week into having eero set up at home and four days in at my small business. My home is a good size, sprawling ranch. I've had trouble for the whole time I have lived here getting consistent wifi coverage all over the house. Two particular problems were the master bedroom (which is on the other side of the house from where the internet signal comes in on DSL) and the basement. I've used two (and sometimes three) apple wifi routers (two extremes sometimes with one airport) along with trying various other supplemental wifi options (those powerline type devices, or even setting up a separate WIFI coming off one of the extremes to try to push signal into the basement), etc etc etc.  I'm vey technical and have been chronically frustrated.I literally set up the whole eero system in less about 15 minutes. It was ridiculously easy. I was compelled by their two way radios (one set for the eero devices to communicate with each other about which was doing what) and one for pushing signal around the house (most wifi systems with extenders of any sort are doing everything on one set of radios, even if many antennas).Okay, 1 week in, Totally amazed. This has fixed EVERYTHING I had struggled with for at least a decade in this house. It's amazing. The signal on my wifi now is strong everywhere in the house, like amazing conveyance of speed I have to work with, strong. It's even made my Ring Doorbell work much better (and that was quite a frustration in itself due to wifi issues). Best part of all: Master bedroom how have huge bandwidth and strong connection to wifi.  And, I've never had as good of connection as I do now in my basement office. My Apple computer in basement is seeing speeds it has never enjoyed before. I am a fan.Adding to this the regular updates and patches (which is not done on most other routers), I am supremely happy. So happy, got another system for the real office away from my home. I have an issue still to work through there to get my Macs to see the server through the eero (PCs all see it perfectly), but that will resolve once I meet with my tech quy and adjust some things. But the perfection of this solution at my house.  Wow. I was hesitant to spend THIS much money but now I'm so glad this option exists and I'd have paid even more to have it.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15TNXUI2SNNK7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1A306IAZ3TM1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Mark J. Rubash",02-Dec-2016,1,"I'm fortunately to have 300 MB service from Comcast and saw ...","BEWARE OF DRAMATICALLY SLOW INTERNET SPEEDS!!!  Purchased the three-pack and installed without any problems. Unfortunately, the speed at each eero after the 1st one connected to my cable modem cuts the available speeds in half! I'm fortunately to have 300 MB service from Comcast and saw this speed on eero #1, at eero #2 the speed dropped down to 45 MB and at #3 was about 40 MB.  In both cases, the eero app indicated that connection between devices was excellent with all bars lit. Also, the performance after upgrading to version 2.0 of the firmware was WORSE than before the upgrade! After a fair amount of research, I learned that this bandwidth drop-off is a design flaw in that bandwidth is being used for backhaul and connecting the three eero devices. I decided to give ORBI a try (as their approach utilizes a proprietary third wireless band for backhaul and connectivity, thereby preserving the 2.4 and 5 ghz bands for use solely by connected devices). I currently have two ORBIs installed (router and satellite) and achieve 295 MB to 65 MB throughout a 6,300 sf two-story home. I plan to add a second ORBI satellite when they become available and expect I'll be well about 150 MB in every room of the house. If you have a smaller home and can place your eero devices fairly close together (20 feet) with NO obstructions, then you might be happy enough.  For me, eero dramatically underperformed the ORBI in a high-bandwidth environment and seemed much more like a kickstarter beta product. Netgear has been making routers and wireless gear for decades and that experience clearly showed in the Orbi product. It's not as simple to setup as eero, but that shortfall is more than made up for by the high bandwidth capability and advanced router functionality.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MWZLHO6A2YLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3ERXU0FIVJOJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

I can get the base unit working, plugged into my cable modem. However, I cannot get another EERO device to mesh connect from a _reasonable_ location. I respected the ""within 40 feet, preferably line-of-sight"" guideline and placed an EERO at about 32 feet away with line of sight.

When I called tech support, it took 25 minutes to get someone (the app has a callback feature...which called me within seconds of requesting a phone call...but then kept me waiting) versus Eero which answered in seconds. Both tech support folks were friendly, but the Google person felt more bound to a script and punted on some basic questions. For example ""How secure is the firewall on the Google wifi?"" question led to this answer ""Google wifi has WEP2 passwords."") The Eero person felt like they were actually providing tech support.Google: I found out in the set up that bridge mode doesn't allow for guest ssid (?!?!). I know many wont need bridge mode, but I don't understand that design. Also, the tech support told me that bridge mode essentially reduces Google wifi to 3 separate access points with different names, which is basically what I have with the Apple Airports I have now. So the Google is going back, and I'm ordering Eero again if I can somehow get the same black friday deal I originally ordered under.Eero: I sent them back on an annoyance with the app,but I hope that has been fixed.

To cut a long, boring story short; while I'm sure I'll find a solution at some point, if you're looking for a simple solution to internet coverage / speed issues, while it will improve both (as it has for me), it's far from the easy solution it claims to be.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RI45R3K3JZZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3H2EBKOM5HGCU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

These worked ok but I still could only get between 18 and 46 Mbps. I was thinking this was as good as it was going to get until I saw the eero product.I purchased the 3-pack and was impressed with how easy it was to setup (via iPhone app). Connected the first to the basement modem which created a new WiFi network and then connected the others throughout the house. I placed one on the first floor and one on the second floor. The eero app you download helps to get everything setup and could not believe how easy it was. I am now consistently running between 112-125 Mbps regardless of where I am at in the house. I also run multiple Xbox one consoles and Netflix, YouTube, etc. are no longer dropping connections.I was able to get the $100 discount so my price for the 3 pack was $399. For me it was well worth because frustration with dropped or slow connections has stopped.One quirk is that after setting up one of the eero, I had to move it but could not get it to reconnect. My solution was to remove it from the network with the iPhone app, reset the device (on the back of the eero using a needle/safety pin), and then adding back to the network using the app. Worked great after that.Would definitely recommend this although the price is a little steep.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMG9R5Q9XWG52/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A223AZWJ2XOLWP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

Reichert",26-Nov-2016,3,"Updated - Works great but is not flawless - Support lets it down","Update 12/3/16 (removed 2 stars): I have a strange problem with eero where virtual machines running on Hyper-V on my laptop struggle to get IP settings from the network's DHCP server. It works about 40% of the time but the other 60% of the time it will either not get any settings or the DHCP server will give it the same IP address as the host machine, causing a network clash.Their technical support seems to be unable to diagnose the problem and not knowledgeable enough (one person asked me what are virtual machines).

I'm getting ready to return this item as soon as I can locate someone that has Google Wifi in stock.Original review:This is a step into the future of home networks.When we moved into our house, an average two-storey family house, I put a Comcast Xfinity Gateway router in the front room next to the cable outlet and the wireless connection to it was shockingly bad. It was really only usable within the same room. I tried other solutions to extend the network but always ended up with two SSIDs that we had to switch over and dark spots where there was no signal.The eero fixed it. 3 boxes spread around my house and now I have strong, fast WIFI everywhere. No dark spots.The setup was super easy, all done via the phone app. Within minutes I had the first box set up with the network created and adding the extra boxes was super quick. No hitches or issues.And now I have the peace of mind that if I move to a bigger house or get a dark spot anywhere I can just buy an extra box and throw it in the system and boom, problem solved. I have only one SSID and can seamlessly use the internet walking from room to room.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33EPDU96E0ZP9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2F1VLX7BHY96U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

While Eero customer service is helpful and responsive their fix to the problem is to hard wire non working devices by moving them close to an Eero device or to buy a new printer.  None of which were tenable solutions.  For $530 my expectation is that I'll have wifi and not have to hard wire anything - or purchase additional equipment particularly if those same devices worked seamlessly with my $100 router.  In any event after working with Eero for quite some time I decided that it wasn't worth the expense or hassle.  I was told I couldn't return it because now it was past 30 days.On black Friday they offered $100 off a system.  I again wrote the company suggesting they provide the credit and I would apply it to a additional single Eero - cost $150 - so I could hardwire my printer.

"Eric H.",26-Nov-2016,4,"Nice! Be careful with ""bridged"" mode at least until the next software update (after 2.0.0).","I bought this for myself after having successfully deployed 2 other eero 3 pack systems. For those installations I used a powerline adapter to attach the main eero and the most remote eero with the thinking that a ""wired backhaul"" was more stable/reliable than the wireless mesh backhaul and could provide better communication to the non-wired eero. I also let the main eeros in those setups ""be in charge"" and handle routing etc (the default/preferred setup).For my setup which a little more complex as I have a dedicated firewall computer and several subnets. I initially tried to use the main eero in ""bridge"" mode. This proved to be somewhat unreliable. Was getting dropoffs and network lags. Support reported that there is currently a bug with bridging for some people and that it would be addressed in an upcoming patch. I did not want to wait so switched over the main eero to ""automatic"" instead of bridged and put it ""in front of"" my home subnet - a double NAT configuration. For the other two eeros - one was connected via powerline to the home subnet and the other was via the mesh (wireless backhaul).Things seem to be working a lot better so far. I did have to do some tricky port routing etc for things like my slingboxes thanks to the double NAT setup but really it wasn't that bad. As a bonus I have a bit more wireless and network control features available to me - profiles etc and that's nice.I'm happy so far - support has been great, product seems to work as expected but still a little early in the game. An old nexus 7 device did initially have some connection issues with the new setup but that seems to have gone away as of this morning.I am looking at adding another eero to round out my setup - primary one in the basement, 2 on the main floor (either side of the house one wired other powerline wired) and 1 upstairs (wireless mesh).","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7BIH59QIYAL5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3U7ODSZU7Y53A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Jeremy Brown",25-Nov-2016,1,"Wifi drops constantly","I bought an Eero to replace my trusty-but-old Airport Base Station which was showing signs of flakiness after 5 or so years.  I wanted something similar to the Airport in ease of configuration, but without having to be configured from software running on a Mac OS machine (which is really heavy handed when I just want to tweak something).  A few friends recommended the Eero, and I'd seen good reviews online, so I decided to give it a try.On the positive side, the Eero is incredibly simple to set up, and the phone app works well.  However I could just never get consistent wireless performance out of it.  One moment it would appear to be working fine; the next moment multiple machines would lose their wifi connections, and I'd have to sit there and unplug / plug in the device and reboot phones until finally things would work again.  A desktop that literally sits about 2 feet from the device would constantly lose its wifi connection.  I eventually had to just wire as many things as possible directly using wired Ethernet, and that seems more reliable.Some cursory Internet research seems to indicate that the problem might be because the Eero doesn't support configuring the wifi channel it uses [...].  If so that would explain why my wifi is so bad with the device; I live in a dense city with 10+ wifi networks visible from my apartment, so there is lots of interference.  It's possible if I lived in a less dense area the Eero would work better, but given how poorly it performs for me I can't recommend it.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31MZJQNE1HFZ5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1PST1QBTBOIX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

With an Apple router of the latest design I got very good speed on the first level, but already on the second with my smartphone I sometimes lost a bar, and despite a signal extender the signal was slow and weak on higher floors.A three pack from Eero fixed us up, and the setup took only a few minutes.  The setup is guided by the smartphone app, which worked flawlessly.  First, you unplug your router and disconnect whatever you've been using for wi-fi.  Then you run an ethernet cable from your router to the first Eero, turn on the power, and follow the very simple directions in the app.  Very soon you are registered, you name the network and the password, and Eero no. 1 is pumping out signal.  Then I went up to the kitchen, on the second level, and powered up No. 2 there.  You then bring it to life with the app, again following VERY simple instructions.  Then I went up to the fourth level and plugged in the final one, again following the app's instructions.

Very easy to install even for people who knows nothing about router setting, just install the app, tap tap tap. Signal strong, no disconnection, simply work. I had a problem before and tried to contact the customer support, their response was super, I got personal help one on one who patiently helped me find the problem.

From the start, I experienced consistent drop offs in coverage (much more than my prior equipment) and the most recent software update (11/17) has completely incapacitated one of the four units I'm using. The app has no troubleshooting instructions for this situation and simply directs me to a generic support webpage for contact options, as if I want to spend an hour helping them debug a standard installation like this. It's particularly disappointing to have a software update actually degrade my service, sigh.Maybe the moral of the story is never buy first-version products like this for a crucial function like networking.

"Brandon",15-Nov-2016,2,"Initial set up was great and easy","I've been using the Eero system for about 6 months now and unfortunately I just can't put up with it anymore.  Initial set up was great and easy, then the software bugs started.  I spoke to Eero many times in the first month regarding issues that to their credit they resolved very quickly with updates to their code.  Most of the issues arose from having a slightly more advance network in place than I think they expect the average buyer to have.  But as I said their customer service was quick and friendly (all knew me by name) and fixed everything they could on their end.  Then the hardware problems started.  Within the first week one of the units died.  Since then four more have died.  The replacements are always sent promptly and the last one they identified as dead before I did.  I realized it was dead when I got an RMA email to send it back.  Now I'm back to software and connection issues.  This evening, for the 3rd time in the past month the ethernet connection on one of the units has stopped working and the only thing that will fix it is removing it from the network, hard resetting, and then readding it back in which now isn't nearly as reliable as it used to be.I will say that when the devices are up and running the experience in nice and throughput is decent so long as you don't keep sustained demand on them.  Unfortunately for me that hasn't been something I've been able to keep consistently.  I'm retiring these and starting the search for another alternative.  Like I mentioned earlier they're a great company and have great support, unfortunately their product hasn't lived up to the rest of the experience for me.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1J4HCVTE28QUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A6DOX89ZPL6T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

But did I need them at home?  Turn out that I don't.  And supporting all of them was a day to day.  Ending on mutiple trips back home or calls from my sons and wife to get back online.  And explain then what to do was not simple.  The old turn off and back on became not just a funny request.So, I got eero, and it took me 5 minutes to install it.  I was able to use my CAT5E backbone that I already had at home.  Results?  100% WIFI coverage and I have a concrete home with lots of steel and concrete walls.  eero was able to provide full coverage in all floors.  Even the basement.Now I know who's at home, who is using it.  Whats speed I'm getting directly from the cable modem router, carrier test was only valid directly from the modem. I can do that remotely now and still have a test directly from the modem.

First test was to try up on the 2nd floor two stories above the router and best I could do before was 10-12 MB speeds.

"John K. Dragoon",03-Nov-2016,4,"Great...but beware if you prefer 5 ghz over 2.4 ghz for speed.","I live in a brownstone condo in downtown Boston.  A crowded area with a lot of competition for bandwidth, channels and frequencies.  My Apple Router worked ok when in range but couldn't reach the 2nd floor.  An additional Apple Airport Extreme as an extender worked ok not great.  Hence my search for the Eero.  Given the overcrowded competition for 2.4 ghz in my neighborhood I configured a 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz wireless network on the Apple router and was able to choose which of the two networks I could join in my condo based on signal strength.  The 5 ghz network FAR outperformed the 2.4 ghz at speeds over 100 mps download for the 5 vs 10 mps or less on the 2.4 ghz network.While the setup of the Eero was easy, there is NO option to configure both a 2.4 and 5 ghz network  The router simultaneously broadcasts both and chooses for you which network, based on signal strength it connects to.  I want the ability to override the automatic connection and force a connection to the 5 ghz Eero network given the speed advantages.  Unfortunately you can't do that. I called Eero tech support and they are aware of the limitation with no commitment to fix.While I love the improved signal strength of the Eero mesh throughout my condo, my inability to choose connection to a 5 ghz network (and therefore suffer much slower speeds) is a major drawback.Net, if you depend or strongly prefer 5 ghz wireless networks - you will not be able to choose this as default option on Eero.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7G1GD77K9RGP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3GZM5JO0DMBZZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Tom",25-Oct-2016,4,"Poor setup procedure","The detectors are great. They work as advertised and are easily monitored and controlloed from my cell phone.The setup is where they could have done better. I bought 5 of these and wanted them all to be interconected. They are and it works great. However, they fail to tell you that you have to activate each detector in the chain when seting up a new one. Even the scond and third from the original three pack. When setting these up, after activating it it tells you to go ahead and install it. If you do you will have to get it and activate it for the setup of the new detector to complete. I had to have all four in the chain going when I set up the fifth.So, If you're installing more than one of these. Sit at a table and do all the setup at once while your comfortable. I would have rate these five stars, but I think this is a VERY MAJOR flaw in the set up. I don't believe they're unaware of the problem, so there doing this on purpose. Not what I'm looking for in a tech company.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQ7LAU3TM5EBH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AFIL2RXLHDIOF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Andrew Stuckey",25-Oct-2016,5,"Simple, sleek and it works","I gotta say I am impressed with this system.  Crazy easy to set up and no more large router with antenna sticking out everywhere in my living room.  Like most, I was concerned about the cost of the product for a company/brand that I have never heard of.  But I've been tired of my existing Wifi network so I knew I was going to go with a full system rather than a standalone router.My setup: 17 wireless devices and 5 wired over a house that is 2-story/3200 sq ft with 200 mbps service.  Modem and router is in the back of the house on the main floor.  So upstairs toward the front of the house really struggled with speeds.  Range was fine but speeds weren't good enough because those are the bedrooms.  My house is newly built in 2015 so the materials in the wall aren't an issue.  Just the distance and plus its much better to have a router upstairs so the signal can filter down rather than downstairs trying to send the signal up.  However, I don't have a choice because of where my only cable line comes in the house (satellite everywhere else).  Over the last year, I've used Airport Extreme, Netgear Nighthawk (all of them) and Onhub.  I've been using the Nighthawk X6 the past few months.  Powerful, but overkill especially when you still have weak spots in the house.  So over the past couple weeks started looking again when I had to start rebooting the router a couple times a week for it to give me my proper speeds.  I had 3 choices: Amplifi, Eero and Google Wifi (when it comes out).  I didn't consider Orbi or Luma.  So I went with Eero.  I was up and running in 10 mins.  Unplug modem, hook up eero.  Power up everything and setup on app.  Done.  I made my SSID and password the same as my other router and all of the other devices immediately connected without issue.So far my speeds have been great all over the house.  Everything loads fast.  As I get further away from the router connected to the modem the speeds drop a little but not by much.  And that is what makes it better than a regular range extender.  You get range AND speed.  They're not hardwired to each other so the speeds I get are excellent considered.  App is great and simple.  Light years ahead of Netgear's Genie app in terms of UI.  Almost everything that's out is ahead of that ;)Couple things I wish it had:1. Additional Ethernet port2. Ability to create different SSIDs for 5GHZ and 2.4GHZ bandsFor someone who wants a lot of advanced options that you would find in a Nighthawk router then you probably won't be pleased with this.  But I really just wanted something I set up, add a guest network and be done.  I don't care about QoS functionality and stuff like that.  So I'll see how this continues to work over the next few weeks and update my review accordingly.  Really with this, price is the major deal breaker for most.  If you can get by that, you should be fine with your purchase.  My review is more like 4.5/5.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROM474CERJ5H7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AGJM390OIKLPZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

I had trouble bridging my router or even knowing that I had to do that, but a great customer service call with Matt walked me through it and we did speedtests before and after.  Company is going to do very well.One issue:  I live in a 4 floor 6000 square foot house and it's not clear to me that 3 Eeros will be enough.  However, I've only spent 500 bucks so far and every network optimization quote I got was minimum 2k in service and new hardware (the fallacy of commercial grade routers).

"Seewolf",07-Oct-2016,5,"Fantastic system","I spent a lot of time looking at different mesh systems and settled on the eero. I couldn't be happier.I previously had multiple wifi networks in my home to provide full coverage over the three floors. I spent quite a bit of time looking at systems from Ubiquiti and Luma. I purchased an Ubiquiti system that was open box and one of the three access points was giving me trouble so I ended up returning it. The Luma system I had on order was promised for months and never arrived. Thank you to Amazon for helping me get that straightened out. Luckily for me, the delay gave me a chance to read reviews of bot the eero and Luma system and I decided to pay the extra money for the eero system.I'm lucky that my home has an extensive wired network in place so I was able to install all three pieces with wired connections - one on each level of the home. I now have fast and strong connections in every room of my home with no dead spots and no need to change from one network to another. The ability to see every device (wired and wireless) in the house is great. My previous main wireless router was the SkyDog system and I got used to having easy access to turn on and off individual devices and assign them to groups. This is great when the kids are spending too much time online and need a gentle reminder that it is time to put the electronics away (although it isn't really that gentle when there access is suddenly shut off!).I've been very happy with the speed of the wifi. My home currently has 80Mbps broadband. My previous system never came close to this speed but I now routinely see the full 80Mbps through speedtest.net or fast.com (when the wifi traffic on the network is low).A couple of things I would like to see:- The ability to hide the SSID. There is currently no way to turn off the transmission of the network name. I usually keep this hidden, in a dense neighborhood I see this as one extra layer of security.- A filter for web content. This is one thing I loved about the SkyDog system (RIP) and one of the big reasons I initially had a Luma system on order but am so happy with the rest of the system the I'm willing to deal with that. By the way, as of the writing of this review I have a friend who did get the Luma system and has been disappointed so far since (according to them) the filter function is not yet active.Overall, I would recommend this system to anyone who needs a robust mesh network to cover a larger home or small office.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XC84RBWSF1TM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3BOIHIV0BE9AF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

In less than 30 minutes, we had our 3 unit eero system up and running with the fastest speed and strongest signals we have ever had in our two story (2,500+ square feet) home.  No dead spots, buffering issues are gone, no more issues where the kids are complaining because the wifi dropped a signal.  Honestly, we don't really think about our wifi any longer - except for when I happen to see the cute little white square, which, by the way is another plus.  Our last wireless adaptor had so many antennas and continuously blinking lights, our living room was starting to look like the Nassau space center!

You can also keep tabs on how many devices are on the network at any time.In my case, the wireless router (TP-Link) that I replaced was acceptable. The eeros just penetrate more of the house. I plan to experiment more with placement, as I plan to add at least one wifi security camera to the network. It would be a good feature if the eero smartphone app guided you on placement or told you if, for example, moving one of the devices to a new location helped or hurt.Overall a fantastic experience in my first few days.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3Q498B6XVSNZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2Z6UW1OTQNI8A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"RickP",02-Oct-2016,4,"Achieves the main objective of whole-house wifi, but does have speed degradation and some spotty problems.","I ordered eero with anxiety given the range of reviews, especially the problems many had with connectivity.  My home has been a challenge as it is large with three main sections divided by concrete block.  I have never had wifi throughout the entire house even with the most expensive long-range routers made, coupled with an external access point on a balcony shooting 5ghz across the patio to the outer side of the house into the family room though the sliding windows.I purchased 6 eeros and I now have wifi everywhere in the house, patio and garage.  Six is a lot, and I am unsure if I could do it with 5, but I bought six and did not try fewer. But these devices are not perfect and I have some concerns, even though I am very pleased to have wifi everywhere.Installation was generally easy using the eero iPhone app.  I have an Xfinity Arris TG862 voice/internet modem and placed it in bridge mode prior to eero installation.  Any one of the three eero devices in the box can be the main unit.  I had to restart the Arris router twice (Xfinity has an app to do this from your smartphone) and the main eero twice before the eero connected.  This took about 15 minutes.  Once connected the eero man device has been consistently connected since September 10,2016, except one time when Xfinity had service problems.  So I can confirm Xfinity Arris devices work with eero, but restart them!After the master eero device was connected, I went around the house connecting the other units.  As you connect each unit, the app guides you and it tells you to maintain no more than 40 feet distance from another eero and that they should be line of sight.  So there is a conflict between ""marketing"" info and the setup because the marketing stuff clearly tells you it is fine placing a unit on one floor and another unit on a floor above or below - which by definition can never be ""line of sight"" unless you plan to cut holes in floors.  Regardless, I was able to connect all units with little difficulty, though two of the units each had to make two attempts to get a good enough signal.All the units provided service consistently until from 9/10/2016 until 9/29/2016.  On 9/29 the eero unit in the family room, that connects my very new Samsung smart dvd player (used for Netflix and Amazon), would not connect to my Samsung.  I powered off and restarted the Samsung several times and it would not connect.  During this problem, my iPhone did connect however, so it is not all devices that had the problem.  Finally, I powered off that eero and the Samsung.  After the eero came back up, the Samsung connected.  However, this happened three nights in a row after 19 trouble free days.  So there is some stability problem that will cause devices sometimes to get lost to a eero device and it is becoming annoying, but it is only one unit.Now about download speed.  I have the Xfinity extreme 150, which has always obtained over 150mbps for wired devices, 80-90 mbps for wifi for devices off the main router and 50mbps to the one access point I had off that router.  Something is odd about eero's speed. Each day the ""master"" eero provides the result of a speed test between it and Xfinity.  This has never exceeded 118mbps.  However, I have a laptop connected to the 2nd rj45 port in the main eero, and it gets 160-180mbps using Ookla speedtest.  How can a device connected to the eero achieve more speed than the eero itself gets?As to the speed of the other 5 eero ""slave"" devices.  I have been unable to get more than 25-40mbps on any slave device.  This is troubling.  Even my access point got 50-80.  A wired laptop gets 180mbps - the eero (master) reports it gets 118mbps - and when that eero master device passes it to the other slave eero units, speed drops to 25-40mbps.  A degradation that great is a problem.  And usually the speed of the slave, during most speed tests begins at about 2-3 mbps for a few seconds and slowly builds to 25.  That latency is also odd.  I talked with eero support before I made this purchase and they told me I could expect a speed loss of ""maybe"" 20% - clearly they were wrong.  BTW, all devices, wired, master and slave eero wifi consistently get 20-25mbps upload, so no loss for upload in speed tests.The iPhone control app does a great job of naming each eero device and telling you what is connected.  But the app does not provide performance for each eero unit - it simply tells you the connection settings.  And the app does not tell you which wifi device is connected to which eero unit.  Those two missing pieces of information are important and their absence is a problem.Overall the eero mesh network was easy to setup and has established wifi around my home that I have never experienced before.  Also it has been easy to manage.  For that I think the system ranks a 4.  But it comes with some stability mysteries and speed degradation that could be a deal killer for some users.  And that smartphone app needs improvement.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JG2M2NSBOLQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AHBP5DJ2WMUT1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Paul Herz",30-Sep-2016,5,"A blissful solution to terrible Wi-Fi","My family's home is an older home, with thick interior walls made of brick (not just brick façade). What's more, it's two stories and it's long. Ever since Wi-Fi came into popular use, we had a single router in a closet at one end of the house — an old Linksys. Of course, that meant that barely one half of the house had Wi-Fi, but this was still in the days of Wi-Fi extension cards. About five years ago, I scrapped that router and put an Apple Airport Extreme in its place, with an Airport Express in the opposite corner of the house. This worked a lot better, but there was a dreaded dead zone in the middle, which became apparent as we walked through it with our smartphones and our current task slowed to a halt. As soon as I found out about this system, which claims to handle good signal propagation for you (provided you place them at a certain interval with line-of-sight), I was very excited. I bought five for the house, and dotted them throughout, favoring the rooms of family members who had chronically complained about terrible signals and speeds for years. After giving the system a few days to ""self-configure,"" (eero's secret sauce), everyone had consistently good speeds and reliable signal in every corner of the house, on every device. What's more, we get the speed we're actually paying for with our ISP. Suffice to say I love this product. I don't think the price is that bad when I compare a single unit to an Airport Express, similar in price and size — the eero does more than the Express anyways. One caveat to anyone looking at these is the speed drop that you may experience when your device is connected to an eero node that is several hops away from a wired connection. eero has reduced this problem compared to standard repeaters, but the fact is that you lose speed with each hop — my solution was to hardwire a few eero nodes using Power over Ethernet devices to get ethernet in the middle of the house.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24W2NJDHAT292/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A4V21SG5BIHGO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Matthew Weirath",28-Sep-2016,4,"Expensive, but they can help out in those scenarios where you need extra range and want simplicity","We picked this up on Prime Day, which I thought was a pretty good price.  We have had other extenders before, but with a normal extender it creates a new wifi name so your devices are constantly having to switch depending on where you are, and it causes issues with connected devices like our Sonos. Eero allows you to setup a seamless wifi system that has the same name regardless of where you are at in the condo, and allows all our connected devices to work seamlessly.  Overall I have been very happy, but there are a few things of note: - The wifi signal does get slower (not by a ton) the farther you get away from the 1st unit, so I suggest putting that unit closest to your major bandwidth hogs - We have had a few issues with the devices, which usually resolve themselves, but worse case you have to unplug them and plug them back in.  I will say that generally they work error free. - They have a reasonable level of customization available, but if you have a lot of networking requirements I suggest you check out their site first.  I don't remember what it was that we lost when we ditched our old network, but I remember it was something we felt we could ultimately live with based on the extra convenience we were getting.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RS5UESQ21UR90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1YWW0WD5ETOI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

But because of the walls being plaster and brick, my old system with extenders just wasn't working.  Now I have almost 20 devices connected (from the video doorbell, to all the computers, TV, sound system, lights, etc) without any issue.  I have an internet service that provides 50Mbps download speed.  Next to the connected router i am getting consistent speed of 57Mbps using netflix's speed test.  At the other end of the house where I have a TV connected with an Apple TV, the test is producing 27-29Mbps which is plenty for streaming.

Getting fed up with this, I decided to try the 3 Eero set as it was on sale. My pack of 3 included one lemon that Eero replaced quickly, and their support team was very helpful. I should note that I have 2 of the 3 hard wired in. I am happy to say that since getting them set up, I haven't had a single issue of dead spots. I can walk around my house freely streaming videos or even on skype/FaceTime and I don't have dropped call issues that I had previously. It turned out to be everything that I had hoped for and I am very happy with my purchase.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RX0QZC0B2EKMC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2HDGP9FDAYP9R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

I still get a decent signal about 150 feet in front of my house outside.  Such a great product for its ease of set up (10 minutes) and ability to easily name and choose a password for your network.  No more staying with the default network name and password that comes on the Verizon router because who the hell wants to take the time how to figure out how to connect to it to change it?  While I (35 year old guy) set up mine and my in-laws, I am confident that even my mom could figure this out and she still needs tutorial every time she wants to transfer photos from her camera to her PC.

The eero in the upper and lower floor are direct wired to my switch. The one in the middle floor is wireless only. Did a speed test with a Ethernet connection from the middle floor eero to my laptop, get to 250mbps pretty constantly which is great. Bought these to be able to have a continuous wifi signal on the same network ID. It takes a little time for devices to switch over, so I sometimes have to turn airplane mode off/on quickly to get the strongest signal. If you wait a few minutes, it does it usually automatically.Important > if you want to direct wire them, then you CANNOT just connect them all to a switch (unless I got that info wrong).

"Springer",15-Sep-2016,3,"Meh, it's ok I guess. Certainly nothing to write home to mom about.","Background // We have had this product since late February. We purchased it because we moved into a 1960s single story ranch house; i.e. a house that has a long, horizontal living space with rock solid bones (thick plaster walls over a solid wood frame) meaning wifi signal(s) have to travel long spans through thick walls to reach ""connected"" devices. Well that quickly proved to be a nightmare for standard single router wifi. Enter eero and its promise of whole home connectivity without any degradation in speed. It sounded magical... like when you find a $20 bill in the pocket of a jacket you hadn't worn since last winter. Gosh that's a good feeling. But I digress. You get where I am going with this. The promise of a product the ends spotty wifi?!?!? Heck ya! Even if it seemed to good to be true, we had to take the plunge. And take the plunge we did. We bought the eero 3pk. Below is a recap of our experience thus far:Setup // Everything started off simply enough. We got the app installed and the first eero online. I thought to myself, ""well this is gonna be a breeze."" To quote Julia Roberts from Pretty Woman, ""Big mistake. HUGE!"" Famous last words, indeed. A breeze it was not. Was it as hard as say, performing brain surgery (which I can only assume is difficult)? No. But was it as effortless as say making a PB & J sammich (which we all know is easy and to that point a lot of connected products been able to achieve PB & J ease of execution -- Dropcam comes to top of mind as an example)? Nope. Sure wasn't. The second eero I tried to install couldn't be found even though it was placed well within the specified range. And, then I happened to read the directions a bit more closely... ""eeros work best when they can see each other."" Well that seems a bit inconvenient for a ""whole home"" wifi system considering there are walls and corners and furniture in the way in most homes (I can't even imagine how frustrating this would be if we had multiple floors in our home). And isn't it a little bit narcissistic of the eeros themselves that they just want to look at themselves longingly all day, every day? That's a post for another day I suppose. Anyhow, back to the review, once I got the eeros to see each other from across the room(s) set-up worked reasonably well enough from that point on and I was up and running.Performance // It's been an up and down experience; a bit of a love / hate relationship so far. Some days I love eero. Some days I hate eero. The days I love it -- it does have pretty good whole home coverage for the most part. I can move from room to room and even be outside and still get a wifi signal without having to change networks. That part does work pretty seamlessly. I like being able to see how many devices are online at any given time and the addition of profiles was a nice enhancement to the system. That's kind of where our love ends for eero. So what is it that drives me banana sandwich about eero? Well for starters, it's super finnicky. Move it even half an inch and it stops working. The glowing white light turns a deathly red. Then no matter what room you're in and even if it's not the closest eero to give you the stink eye (i.e. red light of death) it totally messes with your connectivity and out the door goes wireless fidelity. No more Sonos. No more streaming Netflix. No more nothing.  And then comes the whole wifi speed thing... total made-up hoo-ha. Not even close to accurate. Not even close. Ever. This system absolutely does not deliver on its promise to deliver ""hyper-fast"" wifi across the mesh network. At first I was super pumped to see 100+mbps download speeds from the eero. I began to think of all of the things I could do at once on the Interwebs. So many things, so little time. To say I was giddy like a school girl would be the understatement of the year. Nay the decade. But alas, it was all too good to be true. I opened up some independent speed test apps to see if the speeds jived with what eero was reporting. No way Jose. The independent apps reported that my download speeds were only like 20mbps or 30mbps. That's a far cry from the 100+mbps eero consistently reported. The only time I ever came within 20mbps of what the eero app was reporting was when I was standing directly next to the eero that was hooked up to my modem (it's worth noting that within is the operative word here because even standing at the source I still wasn't getting the reported download speeds the eero app said I was purportedly getting). Wah! Wah! Wah! Sadness ensues. So yeah, I have no idea what sort of funky computations these guys are doing on the backend but I can tell you unequivocally that the speeds reported via my eero app have been erroneous and inflated on all occasions. The whole speed reporting that eero provides feels like a bunch of malarky. Oh well.Conclusion // So in the end, eero is like anything in life. It's both good and bad. What it does well it does reasonably so. What it does poorly it does reasonably so, as well. It certainly isn't anywhere near the best thing since sliced bread -- but I guess what is, really? That said, when you market something as being the best thing since sliced bread it should at least be within spitting distance of that goal and sadly to say that ain't the case here. So 3 stars it gets because if I had to give it a one phrase assessment it would be ""Meh, it's ok I guess.""","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLRFTLD8D5C8N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1CKBMP0GRODNV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"Gerald Barber",15-Sep-2016,3,"Outstanding Wifi System marred by inadequate documentation, buggy software, and virtually non-existent technical support","The Good: The Eero is a great wifi extender. I live in a split ranch house which has 3 levels and is approximately 100 feet from end to end on the main level. It's also almost 60 years old and built with material much more impervious to wifi signals than modern construction. I've tried numerous wifi routers and range extenders in an attempt to provide coverage throughout my house and, until Eero, they all failed miserably with large dead zones in various regions of the house that couldn't be eliminated no matter what I tried. Eero is the first system that I found that is able to provide not only wifi coverage, but a strong signal, throughout every room in my house. Why then am I only giving it 1 star?The Bad: Unfortunately, both Eero software and documentation are incredibly buggy. Moreover, even when a more recent version of the software is released, the customer cannot initiate or force their devices to update and instead must wait for the update to be pushed out to their units by the Eero rolling system. In fact, I've been unable to get the update to the latest released version of the software even after contacting technical support to report an issue that I was having. This brings me to the the other major reason for my 1 star rating, customer and/or technical support, or more correctly the near absence of this support. In a little over a week, I've contacted Eero 3 times. The first time, I received a boilerplate response from their website that was totally unresponsive to the issue I raised. Not only did the text on the Eero website not contain the appropriate information that I required to install/setup the Eero system on my network but also my reply to Eero indicating that their boilerplate response didn't address the question that I specifically asked was completely ignored with no further answer or information provided. It was only through trial and error that I was able to figure out the steps that I needed to take to setup the Eero system. After completing the initial setup, I needed to open some ports on the Eero for forwarding of specific Internet communication to other devices running on my system. I soon discovered that this also didn't work as described. I again contacted Eero support, only to be told that their system indicated that the ports I was attempting to forward were indeed open. Still I could not get external communication to work. Ultimately, I discovered that, due to a bug in their software, even if your device only requires/uses TCP communication, you have to open both the TCP and UDP protocols on the port before Eero with correctly forward the communication to the appropriate device. I recontacted Eero support and was told that they're ""aware of this issue."" Finally, I noticed that, concurrent with replace my router with Eero, my network developed terrible latency issues in communication between local devices. Devices that had near instantaneous response with the old router were now taking 2 to 6 seconds to respond and this delay was causing both software and hardware to fail. I again contacted technical support. It took 2 days to get a response, which was to escalate the issue. It took another 2 days before I heard for the escalation agent and this response just asked for more specifics on my system, which I immediately sent. Now 6 days after I originally reported the problem and 4 days after it was supposedly escalated, I'm still waiting on a response that would actually help me resolve the problem.In summary, if it happens to work with your network out of the box, Eero is an outstanding wifi system. However, you're on your own if it doesn't. The document is inadequate, the software is buggy, and technical support is virtually non-existent. As a result, I cannot recommend this system for non-IT professionals.Edit: 02/08/2017 - Eero now allows the user to initiate a manual update instead of waiting for the update to be rolled out to the device.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3L3UGW7SIRHVJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1S8CB2RSVMM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

Now no need to switch to different wi-fi networks to connect to the chromecast that we need. No complaints. The physical size of the eero is much smaller than I anticipated. Overall great product.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R25BENELEKM0P1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A271PHWDCLNZ5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"nycebo",12-Sep-2016,3,"Eero vs Luma surprise result","I've been wanting an Eero for a long time, ever since it was first announced. The idea of having a mesh network just sounded so appealing. By the time that I finally got around to buying one, a couple of competitors had popped up. The most promising of them is the Luma. So, I actually bought both mesh routers and will proceed to review and compare them here (a copy of this review will be posted on both the Luma and the EERO product pages).DESIGNThe Eero hardware is really awesome. As others have mentioned, it looks like something that Apple would design. Very glossy white and sleek looking. The routers are small squares that lie flat and have power and network cables coming out the back. There's also a USB, presumably for NSCs or printers. Eero also gave extra thought to maximizing radio antenna efficiency: the tops of the routers are modestly rounded to prevent users from putting glasses or other items on top of them (and thus obstructing strong signal).The Luma hardware is pretty nice also. Actually, the honeycomb is pretty handsome on a bookshelf and I like that it comes in different colors. BUT, and this is a big bug, the Luma is meant to stand on edge. And, when the power and network cables are plugged in, it's unsteady. This doesn't matter too much if your first router is in the fiber closet, but it'll fall over somewhat often out in the open and look the eyesore.Edge to Eero.SETUPI have Verizon FIOS fiber running at my home. Setup was pretty easy as I just plugged one end of a network RJ-45 cable into the ONT and then the other end directly into the ""first"" router. Luma apparently also allows for ethernet backhaul, but Eero doesn't at present. Regardlees, I don't use that feature so it's not relevent to me. Moreover, I doubt most buyers of this product will use it either. Anyway...The Luma was set up first. Things went pretty smoothly. I downloaded the app from Android Play store and created an account with username and password. Remember to log into your old router and release the IP address for your ISP. Then I just followed the instructions on the app: powered down the old router, powered down the ONT (aka modem), plugged the network cable into the ONT and the Luma hub, and then plugged them both in. The Luma app on my Google Nexus 6P found the hub immediately, named it and asked me to sit patiently while it registered on the network. Sadly, that never happened. I tried one more time...no go. A quick search online revealed that some Android devices have difficulty. So, I tried setup with my Google Nexus 9 tablet and voila! It registered and I had wireless network. For the next two hubs, I used an old iPhone and things worked very smoothly also. So, perhaps it just didn't like my Nexus 6P. Small bug but no harm done.The Eero set up was also smooth....after I figured out how to release my IP address on the Luma (see below). Basically, I had to power down the ONT and wait a couple hours. Once I did, setup with my Nexus 6P was quick this time round. Again, I downloaded the Eero app and created an account by entering my telephone number and then entering a 6 digit SMS code. The Eero hub was named, registered and had live internet. Good to go.I'll call this a tie despite the Nexus 6P hiccup with Luma. But if you have a Nexus 6P and want to use a Luma, be prepared to need to try a different device for setup. If you're a stickler, edge to Eero.THE APP INTERFACERight off the bat, both Eero and Luma apps are sparse. If you're used to configuring a wireless router in the past,  you will be unpleasantly surprised by the absence of desired features, including dynamic DNS, QoS, IP release, etc. However, I recognize that these devices are supposed to be family friendly and that they are. Following the instructions in both apps is super easy and very efficiently and quickly gets the first wifi puck up and running. NOTE: I must emphasize that the Verizon FIOS ONT needs to release the IP address in order to switch routers. If you don't release it, then you need to sit around for 2 hours with it powered down until does so automatically. This shouldn't affect most users who just buy either the Luma or the Eero. But, if you are planning on testing a couple devices, it's wise to remember.Anyway, at this point, both apps look very similar and clean with their router status view, upload and download speeds and devices attached tab. Furthermore, they let you add new routers to the mesh network easily, name them (although Eero allows for custom names), reserve IP addresses (in advanced settings menus), enable port forwarding, assign wireless devices to a user profile, UPnP, etc. Here's where they differ:The Eero app allows devices to be nicknamed (a super nice feature), allows for a custom DHCP, and allows DNS config if you want to use Google or OpenDNS or whomever.The Luma can't do any of those at present. However, it does allow for IGMP Snooping to be enabled or disabled. Luma also offers a rating filter for all or specified users. I don't know what the movie-like ratings mean but it would seem handy if I had young kids to whom I wanted to restrict content.In the end, they are both pretty similar. If I had to give one an edge, it would be the Eero simply because it allows nicknames for device connections. I dig that.Minor edge to Eero.SIGNALOkay, a lot of words to get to the part that matters most. How is the signal? Alas, this is really hard to quantify. Basically, I walked around all of the rooms in my home with the Wifi Analyzer app and took readings. On average, the Eero was about 2-5 db better than the Luma in each room. Having read some reviews online, perhaps it has to do with the extra 5Ghz antenna. Who knows? But, it was a pretty minor discrepancy and may have had more to do with how the hubs hand off the connection to one another (or don't) than actually signal strength. I will say this, BOTH Eero and Luma very capably covered all corners and rooms of my home. That alone is a tremendous victory compared to my sad history with range extenders that just never satisfied us at all.So, minor edge to Eero but very satisfactory marks to both.THROUGHPUTAfter writing the above, a big surprise here. No bones about it but the Luma just clobbered the Eero. I have no explanation for this, especially after Eero's signal advantage. Basically, my devices would connect to the Eero hubs admirably and all looked well, achieving 120% of my Verizon FIOS bandwidth. But, after an hour or so, throughput would just plummet to about 10-30%. Badly. It made me crazy. Browsing was bad. Streaming was very difficult. My wife (who doesn't care about these tests at all) would complain and ask what I was doing to the network. I ensured that I was running the latest version but it didn't seem to resolve anything. I power-cycled everything. No success.The Luma, on the other hand, functioned well. It would test at 100-120% of my FIOS bandwidth and almost always stay there, even if I ventured to far corners of the apartment. It made streaming on multiple devices, browsing, downloading, and music MUCH nicer than I have ever had in the past. And, the wife didn't complain. All is not rosy though. With some music sources, Luma needs a little attention. Sonos (Pandora and TuneIn Radio) ran into buffering pauses every so often. I'm hopeful that they can resolve this soon.So, I don't have a good answer for why this was the case...especially since a lot of other users have raved about Eero. Perhaps the signal just doesn't steer my devices to the faster frequency connection. Candidly, even the 2.4GHz shouldn't have an issue. It was just curious.Edge to Luma. But remember that you might not have this experience and I wasn’t going to waste more than a weekend trying to nail down the issue.PRICEBecause of the intro pricing for pre-ordering the Luma, it was $250 cheaper for me than the Eero. These devices are already pricey compared to traditional routers so it matters.Edge to Luma.FINAL RESULTSHere's the rub, since Luma cost much less and functioned better, I just ended up keeping it. Yes, the little hexagons aren't as aesthetically pleasing but I can't have complaints about video quality on Netflix and Amazon Prime. Since we don't have cable, HD streaming is very important. So, while others have had good success with Eero, I just can't affirm their experiences. Unless you have extensive streaming requirements or network throughput needs, I think that Luma should suffice nicely. And for the price, it's a no brainer...even if it is only $100 less than the Eero now.But, and it's a big but: both manufacturers really need to keep stepping it up in development. The apps and features are way too vanilla at present. Good signal and performance will only get you so far with more advanced users.EERO (3 stars)LUMA (4 stars)","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LN2K8771FZ7B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1KPFZCS71QKW5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"Shawn H.",12-Sep-2016,5,"Finally a Quality Product Worth Buying","Let me start by saying that I normally don't write many reviews on products, nor do I put my name on them.  However, this is one that I will make an exception for.  I absolutely love the eero systems that I have bought.  And just so you know, I went with the 2 pack to get started.You really can't ask for a more simple setup process.  Simply plug your first eero device into your modem/router and then follow the steps on your mobile app.  Adding a second eero was even easier.In case this helps you with your decision to by, the current house these 2 devices are covering is around 2500 sq. ft and 2 story.  I have one eero upstairs in the media room and one downstairs in the living room.  These 2 cover the entire house with no issue and I can even get coverage out into the front and back yards.I've been in IT for many years and appreciate being able to just set eero up and then forget about it.  Occasionally I'll receive an email saying my devices have been updated to improve security and performance.  Thank you for that!  Last thing I want after working a full day is to come home and have to worry about updating firmware on my wireless devices.If you are a huge techie and want every single wireless or network option/feature to play around with then this may not be the device you are looking for.  But if you are looking for a stable, quality product that does everything it needs and then some, this is a great purchase!

I work from home so I VPN all the time, dedicated connection. Because of my work, I chose to keep my Netgear equipment, which is made of X8 and a R7000 extender plus AC outlet extender, too. I installed both, eeros and left my original Netgear install to see how it worked. As usual, my Netgear continued to deliver, I run 105 Mbps which translates into 70-90 Mbps wireless but with the eeros was a constant 20 Mbps at the most, except standing next to the eero plugged to the modem. I followed recommended setting and unplugged my Netgear router and tested again, without success, eero speed remained 20 Mbps. Let me be clear, eero is a good solution for someone who has not a minimal idea how to plug a router and needs a wifi setup, which most ISP companies will help you install anyways; but to claim hyper speeds, I think it's not the right claim at least not in my home.

We have a 2-story home and my wife has her office in our detached garage. Getting good wifi coverage has been impossible. To try to improve things, I originally purchased a typical range extender. That helped... but it was inconsistent - would sometimes provide a great signal on our second floor and in the garage, but often not - which might have been more frustrating than not having it at all. I was always rebooting it to try to get it to work.I bought the Eero system out of desperation. Didn't want to have to go to a wired system, but didn't have much hope that it would actually do the job. I figured with my Prime membership and Amazon's return policy, I didn't have much to lose. I ordered 4 just to make sure I'd have adequate coverage in our home.From the moment I plugged them in, things just worked. It was like magic. I didn't want to believe it at first - I kept our other router pumping out it's signal thinking that the Eero network would fail at any moment. It didn't. Ever.

"MerrickM",06-Sep-2016,5,"Solved our problems!","The configuration of our house makes a consistent WiFi signal difficult.  The modem has to be upstairs, which makes the reception in the downstairs bedrooms difficult to impossible.  I purchased a signal extender, which worked for a while, but never well or consistently.  When I read about eero, I was very interested.  True to the review, it was VERY easy to set up, with one exception.  It took me a while to figure out the best way to get my Sonos working again.  My wife is far more into Sonos than she is exceptional WiFi coverage, so she quickly declared it a bust.  However, with a little bit of research, I very quickly solved that problem and we now have spotless and fast WiFi in areas where we had no WiFi before. I also have younger kids who love to log back in when it's lights out...eero allows me to schedule their WiFi access, so I can shut them down at night.  I love this product and am considering one more unit in a far corner of our house to make sure our outdoor deck is covered as well.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCEJGT8WEZNL8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2WVYWUUSAMJIT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

I have seamless, fast, rock-solid coverage throughout my house. It was very easy to set up, and the app is understandable. eero is lightyears ahead of anything else. I was reminded of this again yesterday when I set up a Belkin wifi in my daughter's dorm room (I had to go with one of the access points ""recommended"" by the university).When I got home from taking my daughter back to school yesterday, the electricity went out at our house, reminding me of another advantage of the eero. In the past, with the Airport Time Capsule, the electricity would go out. When it came back, I would have to go into my office and restart components in the right order to get them to come back up. This often took 30 minutes or so. Not yesterday. When the system went down, I received an email. When it came back up, it took about 3 minutes or so, but it all reset itself so that we were back on line.I didn't like spending $500 to replace the Airport, but there is no question that this system is the best.

"mikemahaff",06-Sep-2016,5,"Finally","Like everyone who has submitted a review about eero, we could never get consistent, high speed wifi throughout our house. Speeds were half what we could get by using Ethernet, and that was on a good day. At least twice a week we would have to reboot to get a signal. Finally, wifi would not extend throughout our house which meant no TV streaming in our family room (too far from our modem/router). With eero all of that is now a distant nightmare. Our internet speeds through wifi are consistent and the same as Ethernet speed; no more rebooting; and, finally, we are streaming movies with virtually no buffering. That alone gives eero 5 stars and I haven't even mentioned their fantastic support team. Once I knew I could stream I purchased a smart tv for my office in my home where there is no wiring for a satellite box. For some reason the TV could not connect with my eero network. I contacted support and Dave was immediately on it. He had me do some things but most of the techno hocus pocus was done at eero headquarters. In no time, my wifi and my tv were connected and I'm now watching sports while I work.

"Froggy",02-Sep-2016,2,"$500 and performs worse than a $50 range extender.","I purchased an Eero 3 pack in hopes of improving the Wi-Fi situation of my home. I had recently bought a Ring Wi-Fi doorbell, and the signal at my front door wasn't great, resulting in problems with the video feed from the doorbell. I tried some moving my router, and buying some different extenders and experimenting with what will work best. After some playing around, at best I was still only able to get results that were ""ok"" at the doorbell, but nothing fantastic.I've previously heard about the Eero, but at $500 it was going to be a last resort. I bit the bullet and gave them a try, and was awfully disappointed with the results. The setup in theory was supposed to be simple, and I assume it would be simple if you have one of the few smartphones that are compatible with their App, but I didn't. I ended up buying a used Nexus tablet just for this, and spent a few hours just trying to get the Eero app installed and launched. Why couldn't I just use a browser like every other piece of consumer networking equipment ever? Once I finally got the app to launch, I couldn't even configure the Eeros as I lacked a data connection, so I needed to use my neighbor's Wi-Fi just to set things up.It was smooth sailing after the first unit, the next two pretty much configure themselves. That was about all that went well.The speeds were absolutely terrible. With my old setup of being connected via Wi-Fi AC to my router I would be able to average a 400 megabit transfer speed from my server, and when connected to my range extender it would still easily do 200 megabit, more than enough for streaming high quality videos. Doing the exact same tests on Eeros, I never saw faster than 20 megabit. Streaming video with a 30-megabit bitrate wouldn't work, as it would be constantly buffering. Countless hours troubleshooting didn't help, the only solution was to plug in my old router and switch over to that when I wanted to watch something.I also had a weird issue which I could never explain, whenever I shut down my desktop (which was connected by Ethernet directly into my modem, not connected to the Eeros at all), the entire Eero network would go down. The second I fire up the desktop, I'd have Wi-Fi again.There is next to no configuring the Eero, the options are very stripped down and over simplified. No QoS, can’t use different SSIDs for 2.4 and 5ghz, no way to monitor what device is doing what or how much bandwidth is in use or by what. It is a router for stupid people, not people that want to know what is going on in the world.The coverage the Eeros provide is fantastic, it blanketed my house. While I didn’t have any dead spots before, coverage was significantly improved upon. Unfortunately, that coverage didn’t mean much, as the performance was terrible.Back to my original issue with the doorbell, the Eero didn’t help. I had great signal near the doorbell now, but due to the performance issues of the Eeros, video quality still suffered and frequently dropped out entirely. I eventually resolved the issue by disconnecting the Eero’s, and using a Netgear power line networking based Wi-Fi extender. Now the doorbell streams high quality video without issue, at about a tenth of the price of the Eero system.There is a saying that you get what you pay for, this is one of the few times that it doesn't apply","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R381EWGGILFT4F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A15NRXEB0AC65J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

It definitely increased my available speed - the biggest difference was it shortened the 'delay' from 167 to 9!

If you have poor service at the source, like I do apparently, while this does improve the wifi signal it doesn't resolve the source issues and I just couldn't justify paying out the money.

"D. Bacon",31-Aug-2016,5,"Works well with existing ethernet network","When we remodeled our 1944 two-story house with basement, we ran Ethernet cable from the cable modem in the basement to every room in the house.  This is great for wired devices like a desktop computer, printer, TiVo, Roku or Xbox, but so many things are wireless now.  The wired network let us put our wireless router in a fairly central location in the living room, but WiFi speeds dropped to half of wired speeds in my husband's basement office and the kitchen, and disappeared completely in my son's bedroom and husband's garage workshop.  Eero has been the perfect solution.  I got the three pack and placed each one on a different floor, zig-zagging horizontally across the house.  I plugged each Eero into an Ethernet jack, so they talk to each other through my existing wired network.  My son now has an Eero in his room which also improved the signal in the kitchen, and the Eero in the basement has improved the signal for my husband in his office and also his garage workshop.  We now can get full 60 mbps WiFi speeds anywhere in the house.  Everything works, including iPhones, Apple/Windows/Linux laptops and tablets, WeeMo switch, Kindle, Aria Scale, AmbientWeather Station, as well as the wired devices I mentioned earlier.  The fact that Eero is actively updating the router software gives me hope that this router will be resistant to malware attacks.  It was expensive, but I think the price was reasonable for three routers that work seamlessly together, allowing your devices to roam between the different access points.  Three Eeros are the perfect number for our 3000 square foot house.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11GASH934NQTT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1RB25H2OU6JQL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Omar Shahine",29-Aug-2016,5,"Eero vs Luma","On paper, these two companies are similar. They are startups that are well funded, and have recently launched devices that are about the size of an Apple TV or an Apple Airport Express. You typically buy a pack of 3, plugging one into your modem and the others to ethernet or leave alone and they will create a wireless mesh network. eero has been the market longer than luma.If you have Sonos, then you are already familiar with mesh networks. Like Sonos, these devices can talk to each other via wireless, as long as each one can ""see"" the other. From there they re-distribute the wifi signal creating a constant amount of coverage.These devices are also incredibly easy to setup and manage (in theory). You do everything from your phone app. And you can manage your network from anywhere. They are cloud powered routers. eero has written a lot about their cloud operations. Impressive.However, that is where the comparisons end. I have used both devices now and can weigh in on which one is better. I got an eero for my father and set that up in May. I also got a Luma for myself, and waited a few months longer to get that. Then I also got an eero for myself after some disappointing results with the luma.Below is my experience with both.UnboxingThe clear winner here is eero. The simple explanation is that the eero is like unboxing an Apple Product. The box is easy to open, the materials are top notch (glossy white plastic and soft touch rubber). The charger and finishes are exactly what you would get from an Apple Product.The Luma on the other hand feels cheap. The power plug is gray, but exactly like any other electronic product. The device box is cheap plastic feeling. For many people this device will be visible in their home (like it is for my parents) and so I think this matters.Oh, almost forgot. It was comical hard to actually open the luma box. No product should be hard to get out.Winner: eeroSetupTo set up each device, you install their iOS app, then plug in the first device and go through the setup process.The eero device completed setup in under 10 seconds. It was what I expected, so I didn't think much of it.The luma device took a very long time to setup and failed multiple times. This repeated with each device I set up. It was a bit baffling to be honest.Once the devices are set up, you are now ready to add more devices.Winner: eeroSoftware updatesBoth devices manage software updates automatically. With the eero you can see what version you have. The software updates automatically overnight, and in the latest app update they added a mode where you can force an update. You can even see release notes here.The luma does not show you any information about what version of the software it's running and there is no way to update, or see release notes or anything.It's worth noting, that when I was setting up my father's eero devices, the software updates never came down. I called eero and talked to a live person and he was pretty amazing at getting it resolved. It took a few calls and emails and they determined that one of the devices was faulty and they overnight shipped a replacement the next day. I didn't have a chance to work with luma on anything like that, but the experience with eero was very impressive.Winner: eeroPhone AppAs I mentioned you do everything from the phone app. In the case of the eero I can manage my network and my Dad's from the same app. When I next visit my sister, I plan to get her setup with eero as well and I'm guessing she will need at least 5 devices.In each phone app you can do things like manage your wifi setup and password, choose a guest network (and share the network name and password), see all the connected devices and also create profiles for each person in the house and do some basic parental controls.Right now, I think the luma app has the edge because it has a visual map of your wifi coverage which I find handy. Winner: lumaParental ControlsBoth apps offer basic parental controls. The reason I wanted to get the luma was that they had said they would offer very deep parental controls. In that time eero added parental controls and luma still hasn't delivered on what they said they would offer.Here is the deal. They are both limited at this right now. The best parental control device (and generally useful network management device) is the Circle with Disney. I will review this soon, but I can tell you right now that it's 5 star.Circle, the most advanced parental control deviceWinner: tieReliability and PerformanceThese are highly complex devices making your life simple and easy. The first few months for eero were bumpy and that's also true for luma. Amazon Reviewers rate the eero far higher than luma (4.4 star for eero vs 2.9 stars for luma). There are some very troubling issues with luma that will be resolved with time. For one thing, the Amazon rating trajectory for them is rather bad. They will need to fix this.The biggest issue I immediately ran into with luma was that every few hours, my iPhone, PC, iPad would spin for a few seconds before completing a task such as loading a web page.I though maybe that was just me.... but no, my wife and kids noticed it to. I did some light trouble shooting turning parental controls off and so on (this is before we had the Circle). I also did a lot of speed tests. I have 120 Mbps service from Comcast and with the Luma not once did I ever see sustained performance hard wired. The eero however has constantly been clocking in at my full bandwidth.In the end, my tolerance for this stuff is super low. Internet needs to work always and work well. I returned the luma after 2 days and my life with the eero has been glorious.Winner: eeroCostThe luma is cheaper. This is by design as eero was the first to market and has a lot of mindshare. To get people to pay attention, I believe luma undercut them (the 3 pack is $100 cheaper from luma).However, this is an important investment for your house. I would not recommend getting the luma due to its lower cost. That $100 could be a big deal in the long run.When purchasing I'd recommend getting the 3 pack as each device is priced at $166 vs $199 individuals. There is also a 2 pack. I got one 3 and one 2 pack.Winner: lumaFinal ThoughtsIt's really exciting to  me that wifi is entering a new era. Surround wifi will solve dead spot and coverage issues for so many families.I fully expect the luma to resolve a number of the problems I identified. However, at this time the eero has been in the market longer, and is the clear leader.I am super happy with my setup. I now have 5 eero devices in my house, they are all hard wired except for the one. I have replaced everything else powering wifi in the house and it's glorious. I highly recommend getting eeros.Winner: eero","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HLY5E01VZYLO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1M841R4VB4AVY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Srinivasa",29-Aug-2016,5,"Expensive but worth every penny","My home is split over 3 levels. I have a 300 mbps connection which I could never receive reliably or at any significant speed down in the basement. After trying out numerous alternatives (routers, access points, extenders, and power line adapters), I stumbled on eero. I now have 4 of them spread over the house and get the expected 300 mbps from anywhere the house. An expensive proposition at $600 for 4 units -- but boy -- has it been worth it !!The installation process is super slick and I can see that this will be how setup applications will be in the future -- with a fancy app that guides you at every step and knows what you are doing. A couple of weeks or so after I had installed the eero units, I decided to turn off the WIFI on the router provided by the cable company. This actually improved the performance and reliability of the entire eero system and I suggest everyone do this.One odd thing that I have noticed is that if the internet connection goes down, the eero that is connected to the router gets very hot. I mean really HOT -- and it may be something the eero folks need to worry about -- perhaps some venting slits in the side or the top of the unit may be required to prevent damage to the unit if the internet connection goes down for extended periods of time.Apart from this observation regarding an edge condition -- I think the eero is a game changer and a truly amazing product.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RP9DCGNGHG0JU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CYB8863WH636/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

The nice aesthetics is a plus: you can place the eero stations in plain sight without your wife complaining about some ugly piece of technology being out in the open like the Linksys line of devices.  I did run into a problem where my cable modem (Arris SB6183) firmware caused conflicts with the eero (which is documented on their web site).  My ISP was unable/unwilling to update the firmware, so I had to upgrade my modem (SB6190) and now all is well.  It is a pricey system, but well worth it when considering the setup ease and reliability of the system.  I haven't had to restart my eeros like I had to with other routers.

I found a series of issues which resulted in a return.– While it did create a mesh network, each 'hop' cuts the download speed in half. If you pay for 150 Mb down, and you are at the end opposite side of the house, expect to get at most 1/2 your speed, possibly 1/4 or less.– Intermittent speeds, even when standing directly in front of the main unit– These units also got very hot– My three year old Apple Airport Extreme (Gen 6 / A1521, current version) outperform eeros in all respects. In fact, after fiddling with placement and tech support calls and finally returning the eeros, I revisited my Extremes and named the four SSIDs the same name – it roams seamlessly now.– It's odd that you need to provide both your cell phone and email address to set these units up– I added a star, because out of the box, if you get this for grandma, they do seem to blanket a house with coverage, it's just slow.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29VBAQU246QY4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AS8MGXJC8538E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

I love that I have the option to control the DNS settings.I waited months for and tried the LUMA wifi system.  It installed fine but I was very disappointed with their lack of features on launch and their promises to deliver their features must have been talking about later generations of software.  A call to support was pleasant however their roadmap to include the features (like DNS customization) wasn't on their roadmap yet.  Performance was very painful and since they don't string / daisy chain to each other (each device has to connect back to the main hub device) I was limited in my reach.Then I tried Uniquiti wifi.  I used them in a corporate settings and they are simple screaming APs however I wasn't able to run a hardwire eathernet cable to each one so I had to return them.I finally spent the extra $ to go with Eero and I was so impressed.

We just moved to a house that needed more coverage and a mesh network seemed perfect.  The promised ease of use was even better.I have had this for two months.  First I set it up as a node off the main network, and I had a lot of problems with speed when the Eero wasn't the router.  I then switched it to be the router for my entire network, at which point the wireless nodes started interfering with the Sonos system.  This was discovered after weeks of interactions with customer service.  The result was that download times would drop to 1-2 mbs on the wireless network (I get 300mbs normally).  When I disabled all my Sonos units, this solved the problem.  Then the two Roku units started having issues.  Again, after more weeks with customer service, I'm at a point where Netflix won't work on any device (including a TV without a Roku), none of the Rokus will work wirelessly, and I have continuous problems with sites in a wired format.I switched back to my Airport Extreme for my router and all problems solved.  But now am having speed issues again using the Eeros just as wireless access points.  So I will switch back to my older airport expresses.I have literally spent months interacting with customer service.  Changing my DNS settings.  Resetting every possible setting on the Eeros.  Dedicating ports.  Disabling everything else on my network.  I asked to send the product back because as far as I'm concerned, it's defective.  They then told me that since I bought it on Amazon, and it is past 30 days, nothing they can do.In the future...don't try to fix it...just send it back.  Before 30 days are up!  And let me know if you want to buy a (slightly used) 4 Eero system :-)","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RW7O1S4CMUATQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1IZ2KS1NKB6TD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"Paul S. Taylor",26-Aug-2016,4,"This gives me great coverage all over my house","This gives me great coverage all over my house, and the wireless devices seem to move from AP to AP easily, not trying to stick to an AP upstairs when you've moved to the other side of the house, like I experienced when setting two standalone APs to use the same SSID.  Great community on Reddit.  Speed test results in the App are usually way off, compared to Ookla.  I had been waiting on a Luma system but with their delays, then I read that Eero has an update with Parental controls, so I ordered.  When I think parental control for an Internet related system, I think of content filtering.  Eero's parental controls are about schedules for individual devices, not content filtering.  If it did content filtering, I'd probably give it 5 stars, assuming it was as good as the quality they have put into everything else.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TDOHJYSJ30JJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AD366LGL88Y7W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Peter C. Neuman",24-Aug-2016,5,"This product is fantastic and requires very little knowledge of networking as it ...","As a network engineer and private network consultant I am occasionally asked to set up or upgrade home networks for employees at the executive level of the companies I support. This purchase was for a very large home in Westchester, New York. A castle actually which is primarily made of solid stone and very irregularly shaped.  Multiple floors and upwards of 20K + square feet.  The system they had, consisted of several apple airport extremes and expresses and they were constantly having issues with the in-home wifi.  Signal drop outs, dead spots etc..  I had recently purchased an eero kit for a much smaller home and had been impressed with the simplicity of the setup and the performance so I decided to implement it in this castle.  It took three kits of which we used 8 out of the 9 eeros.  We removed every apple product from the network and replaced them with an eero.  In some spots, we actually didn't need to place an eero unit where there had been an apple product because the signal coming from the other erros was covering the area more than sufficiently.  By the time it was over, my client was thrilled not only with the throughput speeds in all areas of the castle, but also the setup process.  He installed the app on his phone and tablet and was loving the process of adding the erros to the network.  This product is fantastic and requires very little knowledge of networking as it pretty much configures itself.  From an IT perspective, I like the ability to dive in a little to the configuration and advanced settings options where you can manage each erro with specific settings to accommodate each rooms specifications.  About 5 of the erros we installed were hard wired to the master switch and the other 3 were picking up the wifi signal and extending it.  All without issues, errors or signal irregularity.  If you have a home or small business, look no further.  Buy this, install it, have fun while doing it, and kiss your wifi issues goodbye.  Bravo Eero!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2IB27WGU96DZB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2KENWO5J6J9GK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"T. Pope",23-Aug-2016,5,"Awesome system, easy to setup and works as advertised!","After much debate due to the higher cost of this system, I ordered the Home Wifi system and set it up yesterday in my home.  First step though was to replace my current Xfinitiy cable modem/router with just a cable modem so as to remove any potential conflict with operating the new system behind the old router. (I had read that Arris modem / wifi routers don't work well with the router portion turned off).  I installed the new modem, called Xfinity (Comcast), registered the new modem and plugged the first Eero in.  Step 1: download the software onto my iphone.  Step 2, followed the prompts.  Step 3, I installed 3 eeros into my home in a matter of 10 minutes and instantly the wifi in the house was improved.  All the dead zones I had (even with access points setup) were gone, and my upload/download speeds are what they've been advertised.  This is the simplest wifi router system i've ever setup and their claims of no more buffering, no more dead zones...absolutely true.  This system is worth every penny.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFYIG84PBH5X8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A17082W0P9HXBR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

The app can test download speeds and upload speeds at various points in home. My download speed of iPhone increased 4 times from 24 bps to close to 100 bps consistently (after 24 hrs, the effect is even more prominent). My corner bedroom which used a slow PC got a 3 times boost in download speed. I have tried two other systems before (Azeus and extenders), but this system is the only one you will ever need. My house about 4000 sq feet and since I installed this, there is a huge difference.

If you have a big house, just do it.","My 3 eeros replaced a custom setup using DD-WRT flashed into a Buffalo router and a bridged Apple router in a large house.  Eero was easiest setup ever. The first day it was somewhat slow, as measured by a couple of test apps running in an iPad Pro. But eeros updated their firmware overnight and the system became progressively faster. Since 3rd day, by far the fastest and most complete coverage I've ever had in the house. So far we've experienced no problems, even with as many as 15 devices connected and 3 streaming simultaneously. Both my iPad Pro and wired PCs regularly report 80 - 90 megabit/sec downloads over a Comcast cable in a somewhat rural location. It's actually a little hard to believe. We have had one extended power failure, and the eero network brought itself back online normally when power was restored.Eeros do not yet support IPv6, although it is promised as ""coming soon"". I'd like to add one more eero to improve coverage in one corner of the lower level of the house (although the existing setup does reach there). However, the per-unit cost of a single additional eero is much higher than the per-unit cost of my set of three.  The manufacturer should offer a better add-on price for existing customers.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1X8DC94SHJDB8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A21MXHNDHIF03G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

Setup was a breeze and I was up and running in less then 5 minutes with the first eero. The remaining 2 were strategically placed in my house for the best coverage in less than 10 minutes. These offer better more reliable coverage inside and outside of my house than I've ever gotten with any other combination of router with range extenders. These are easy to set up with the instructions and there has not been a single dropped signal like i would get with my router. I haven't had to unplug or restart anything. I have an Iphone and the app you need to set the eero up is easy to use and intuitive. It also has a speed test in the app so you can see what you current upload and download speeds are. I haven't tested this against anything so I can't speak to it's accuracy. I use a switch in my office to connect my computers and peripherals to the network. People complain about the cost and I agree they are pricey but after you spend money on a good router and research the numerous other options for extending coverage you could get to the same cost very easy. You don't have the multitude of options you get with a router for setting up your network but I feel most of those are overkill for the average user.

"P. K.",19-Aug-2016,4,"Excellent product, a little pricey, and customer support is AWOL but excellent nonetheless","Ok, I've had these in place for a few months now. Long enough to have an opinion.First of all, they are very ""Appleish"" in the design and appearance. Even the packaging. It is quite nice. Assuming you have an iphone or ipad to run the app on, the setup is very simple and nearly foolproof. To be fair, I didn't try the Android app but based on other reviews, it appears that the ios app is more refined. They have simplified the product setup (perhaps too much?) and made it a breeze for anyone, even without technical knowledge, to get these up and running quickly and painlessly.Once the 3 APs are up and connected to each other, ""it just works"". Bravo! I can attest that these absolutely fixed WiFi dead spots and weak signals throughout my house. I replaced an Asus 802.11ac router/AP with these and the difference has been fantastic. Yes, yes... I know, some of you are screaming about ""if you know how to configure.. blah blah blah"". I know how to configure it - I've got many many years and all the silly certificates and whatnot. That isn't the issue.The app has a really nice indicator with status and how many devices are connected. One very nice addition is the speed test. You ""pull down"" the screen and it runs a speed test and displays the results right in the app. Nice touch. I also like that I can create and share a guest network in seconds with the app. Very nice. The lack of physical ports on the devices isn't that big a deal. A cheap switch plugged into one of those solves that problem forever.Now for the not so great...Because this is simplified for anyone to get it up and running and even manage it, it lacks some advanced features or tweaks. I have some wireless devices that are a little bit finicky. A thermostat for example works like a champ on 2.4 GHz but has erratic connectivity on 5. Don't know why, it just does. The app would benefit from an ""expert mode"" or something like that where I could define those things. I also would like to have the option to define the channel being used. If that is some kind of magical ""we pick the best one for you"" type of thing, I'd like the option to see that data. Finally, lets talk about the price shall we? This is a pretty expensive product. You could get the same ""mesh"" functionality from Ubiquiti's UniFi or use some power-line devices if you just need to connect a couple of devices away from your modem. WiFi range extenders are a cheaper option although they aren't nearly as slick or reliable.Then we have this awful moment;  The 2 devices that aren't wired directly into my modem would randomly disconnect and show a red status light. They'd come back after 30-60 seconds but this constant up/down cycle went on for days. Instead of fussing with it, I fired up the app, navigated through the help section and emailed support with the information requested. Then --- crickets. No acknowledgement, no reply, no help. searching some internet forums, I'm not the only one to have this issue. I basically had to remove everything and go through the setup routine all over again while moving the 2 wireless APs around a little bit to get  a better signal. Not exactly sure why it ran fine for so long then suddenly became unstable, but it did.I thought the lack of any response from support may have just been an oversight so I followed up the original ticket with a second request. Nothing again. Unfortunately, it appears that email support is non-existent. I didn't call the phone number but, I don't think I should have to. These are not cheap by any measure. Maybe the time, money, and effort put into the pretty packaging would have been better spent ensuring that customer support was top notch. I'd rather the product came in a brown paper bag and get stellar customer support than pretty packaging but nobody to answer my email.Overall, if you care about aesthetics and you want to cover a large area with seamless WiFi, this is a great product. If you are more price sensitive, take a look at some of the alternatives. And finally, if you are not comfortable with suspect customer service, you may want to wait while, what I assume are growing pains, are resolved before you purchase.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXS5OYHO0BH23/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3HAWR8RE0LKDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Stanley Grant",17-Aug-2016,1,"Very unreliable","I really wanted to like the eero.  Unfortunately, it does exactly what it says it does and that is the problem for me.  When the eero is up and running, it is a delight to use.  I get great coverage, fast speeds, and updates when I’m not using it.  The problem is that when something goes wrong, there is no way to tell why.  Is it because of updates?  Did my cable modem drop?  Did one of the units crash?  All I get is “offline”.Also, the system is smart about when updates occur, but if you change your schedule, it doesn’t seem to adjust.  For the last week, I’ve needed to get up an hour earlier than normal.  Each day, I’ve woken up to all of the eeros “offline”.  The first day, I figured it was updating, let it go and used my phone instead.  If it was an update, it took over an hour and left two of the units (I have four) offline afterwards until I rebooted them much later in the day.  The second day, same thing, but I rebooted the units.  This is day three and to say I’m frustrated is an understatement.  I ended up plugging in my old router, found the network was there, the eero just went “offline” for some reason.Here are the problems for me:• Cannot schedule updates – days where I change my schedule leave me hanging high and dry for network access• No way to tell why the units go offline – the units seem to go offline frequently (couple of times a week).  No way to tell why or how to fix it other than walking around and rebooting them• Updates take a long time – I’ve seen the network go down for as much as an hour and then come back up.  Assuming that was for an update as the cable modem was still connected to the internetThe bottom line is that when it works, it’s great.  When it doesn’t you’re left guessing and going around rebooting units – just like any other router (except with those, I can at least figure out what’s going on).  So, I see these as faster, less reliable versions of the routers I replaced them with.  Personally, I’ll take the speed hit in order to have better reliability.  After a month and a half, I’m already regretting the purchase and looking to replace eero with something else.Update:It's been one week since my 2 star review.  Lowering to 1 star.  Every single day, the network is out in the morning.  Just this week, it has gone out at night before I go to bed twice.  Why is it out?  Who knows?  Who cares?  Bottom line is I'm spending more time without network access on the eero network for no reason that I can figure out (old router still gives access - had to plug it back in to deal with the eero outages).  These routers are complete garbage.  They worked great for the first month, but now instead of having to reboot two routers a couple of times a month, I'm having to reboot four routers... every... single... day!  Sometimes more than once a day.  I'm done with these.  I'm going back to my old network config.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GM3JOAEBNJUN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/APNRDXLYQJE6V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

I also found the connection to be slower with Google Hangouts with video connections very iffy.  So returned it--cost me about a hundred dollars since I waited a bit beyond the 30 day window.  Disappointing but there it is.  Seems to be a nice setup if you have a good fast internet connection and a large area to cover.  Was not noticeably faster with my setup (Netgear Nighthawk AC1900) and the cost is high.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3BGKTXXP457QO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A31UZUH6XGY26A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

My son who is in the computer technology business set up commercial extenders  that never extended the wireless consistently up in the cottage. Albeit it was older technology but still should have worked. Finally after so many complaints from renters I asked him to please figure this out. So he bought the 3 pack and replaced all the old extenders with the eero's.  It worked like a charm and even extended it into the patio area. Our renters were so excited that they didn't have to sit scrounged by the window trying to pick up a signal. We have had it now 6 weeks without any complaints. I like the fact that you can tell on your phone which eero is down. All I had to do was u plug it and replug. Came right  back up online. So far  so good . Love it.

"Michael Brown",09-Aug-2016,5,"Very happy customer here!","Very happy customer here!  I first heard of the eero system from the Cult of Mac podcast (if you're an Apple fan and haven't heard it yet, I highly suggest you give it a go).  One of the podcasters was raving about how the eero had massively improved the wifi coverage in his home, and I was instantly intrigued.  My house is about 1,300 square feet and the modem sits in one corner while the Apple TV sits in the diagonally opposite corner.  Before eero, shows on Netflix, Amazon, etc. would constantly pause to buffer, which of course can be quite frustrating.  The price tag for the three-pack eero system is a hefty one, no denying that, but I justified the purchase because I had some Amazon gift cards that covered half of the cost...and I'm very glad I made that purchase!  Setup was so easy: download the app to your phone and it walks you through in a matter of minutes.  It's suggested that you place your eero devices within sight of each other, but the physical structure of my house makes that impossible.  I have one in each opposite corner, plus one in the hallway in the middle of the house.  It works perfectly!  I will note that the first day I used the system, I noticed a couple of times the blinking light on the devices that indicated loss of connectivity.  However, during that first night the system did its initial software update (so cool that it does it on its own!), and ever since then it's been running flawlessly.  Strong wifi signal throughout the house, zero loss of connectivity, zero spontaneous Netflix bufferings.  If you can swallow the cost of the device, stop thinking about it and just buy it!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QR3SGNZVEYTT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2KNP1F3L4ZQCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

It is really disappointing. When it works, it's great, but it's becoming very inconsistent and I am having a 3 week long conversation with support to try to remedy the situation.

"C. Fries",07-Aug-2016,5,"The best invention for the internet, since the internet of the internet","I have tried everything to get a better wifi signal, strength and consistency of both in my house for years. I live in a single story that is a decent size, almost 3,000, so there's a lot of ground to cover (wifi wise). I also have a smart TV in the back yard, so it is actually even bigger ground to cover. At first I tried to improve my wifi changing ISP from AT&T to Time Warner's 300mbps download speed. That didn't improve the wifi-strength to the other side of the house from where the modem was located. Then I tried TP Links along with Netgear range extenders. They helped, but weren't consistent. Some days decent, some days terrible, but never exceptionally good performance, even on their best days. Didn't know what to do, then was recommended Eero. I was skeptical, as nothing had really worked in the past, but I figured I could return it if I was in no better shape. Well, no need for returning. First, the set up was idiot proof. Literally as simple as 1, 2, 3. As close to plug and play as you can get. Now, on to the important part - performance. I was blown away with how strong and how far the signal carried. I was able to stream Netflix on the family room TV and the backyard smart TV, which are located on the other side of the house to the modem, with no buffer, crystal clear picture, and immediate downloading. I was able to use multiple devices simultaneously throughout the house with no loss of strength, and I run a lot of equipment from security cameras, video door bell, multiple TVs, computers, iPads, laptop, iPhones, solar panel monitoring, etc.This is hands down, the best product for the internet since the invention of the internet.

I have one unit plugged into the feed from my cable modem at one end of the house, with the second unit at the other end of the house. The second is only plugged into power and relays over the wireless - I get plenty of speed to stream HD video / audio / voice calls to my devices at that far end of the house, no problems or hiccups. The third unit is in my shop, beyond the far end of the house. There's definitely a little bit of speed loss out there, but it works just fine to stream howto videos on youtube or music. It's way less effort than trying to run cat6 everywhere, and better throughput than powerline, especially going out to the shop.I do run in bridge mode, so I'm not using Eero to do do routing/firewall - I really got it to do mesh wifi, and it does that brilliantly. The automatic firmware updates happen overnight during low/no usage periods, quickly, and I've never actually noticed it happening.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3EE1G0AFS7OFR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A18446TZSPOKK5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"R. McCabe",03-Aug-2016,5,"Simple solution for a traditionally complex problem","Delivers seamless and continuous wifi coverage throughout the whole house.  Previously, we had been using multiple wireless routers which each created a separate SSID/Network which apps and connected devices couldn't communicate with each other if they were on different SSID's.  This caused many problems and hassles, let alone managing and resetting various routers.  Especially when I started adding smart home devices this became a bigger issue.Setup was simple and quick.  I like that they are constantly improving the device and apps, and I can create profiles for different family members and associate their devices to their profile, then create schedules for when their wifi on their device will or will not work, or if someone looses wifi privileges, i can disable them not the rest of the house.Best of all, their support is phenomenal!!  Quick, detailed responses, and they follow up to make sure the issue are resolved.

My network sits behind a firewall that is doing the DHCP. In order to get the device setup, and routing correctly for all the fun devices on my network (4 Sonos boxes, Ring doorbell, couple others), you must first setup EERO in front of the firewall. Next step was to then change the IP address to a range within the private network. And lastly, switch into bridge mode. It then takes 15-30 minutes as each EERO needs to restart, and pass along the info.This was critical in order for all the wireless devices to be able to talk to one another. I think a youtube video showing exactly how this works would be helpful. Again, it may be up there by the time someone reads this.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8BSJHDIK90DM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2OH5NT2ZQF54Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"F. Huang",02-Aug-2016,5,"End your WiFi woes. Wish I had purchased the Eero much earlier.","I was extremely skeptical of this solution as I consider myself (and take pride in) as being someone who is sophisticated in the ways of home networking. My wife and I moved to a new home and for the past 2 years have been struggling with trying to find a way to get predictable and reliable WiFi around the house.Our home has two levels and most of the time we saw extreme degradation in bandwidth once we were about 25-30 feet away from the router (Netgear AC1750). There must be some kind of building material that hampers the signal and I was hopeful that the AC1750, with it's 3 large antennas, would help solve this, but it was no good.  We resorted to using the AC1750, two Airport Extremes (Gen 2) using powerline ethernet to get full coverage of the house.  However, I consistently noted that my devices had a hard time switching to the strongest access point.Enter the Eero. A friend swore by it and reluctantly I plunked down $500 and thought that this solution would be going back to the manufacturer as yet another wifi solution that would fail to deliver. I was totally wrong. Installation was a breeze with the iPhone app and within 10 min, the system was up and running. I ran a few speed tests in the dead spots of the home and my wife was asking me why I was screaming. Performance at the edges of the house was the same as it was with direct line of sight to the primary router.  I also tested watching video as I passed from one end of the house to the other and you can see the Eero system intelligently and seamlessly switching access points once WiFi signal degrades.My only regret here is that I had waited so long to buy the product. Websites all have a faster load time and I was able to downgrade our service plan from Comcast from 100Mbps to 25Mbps since we primarily surf the web and watch Netflix. In an unexpected way, the Eero will actually pay for itself over time as we don't have to pay for higher bandwidth coming into our pipe.  Looks like my parents are getting a network upgrade with all of my old gear and I am also relieved to have cleared the house of a lot of peripherals. What a relief.One small feature request: please let us turn off the white status light so we can sleep at night.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3D9IHRVVE97JO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1C9RHK2F8D0KL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

That was a good move on my part considering the issues with delivery that they are having. eero does deliver on all fronts, just as advertised. The setup was extremely easy, the performance is solid, and the devices are aesthetically pleasing.CONS: The one drawback that I find, and I just can't seem to get over is the obvious lack of ANY sort of reporting. The app is literally a single page that tells you your devices are online, and what the results of the last speed test were (which is normally wrong). Other then that, you can only set up a rudimentary schedule for the kids that 'pauses' the internet. There is nothing that shows you total bandwidth used, types of sites (streaming media, social media, etc) or which device is using all of your bandwidth. This device would be horrible for someone with metered bandwidth, or data caps.All in all, I am happy with the product. It does what is says it will, and doesn't over-promise anything.

Or, perhaps it was crowding on the frequency due to 15 in range networks.Regardless, by plugging in two Eeros (in 5 minutes), all those problems VANISHED and my internet speeds from my wifi devices increased by an order of magnitude.

"Mary",30-Jul-2016,2,"Wonderful setup experience, but our internet speeds took a huge hit...","We were really looking forward to having a mesh network 'cover' our home. This Eero network was the 'big present to myself' after having been tortured by years of slow internet AT&T (max 18mps.. no, that is not missing a zero). This was to be the one-time big ticket purchase that was going to be the cherry-on-the-top of making a big investment in having an internet that just works. Sadly, it didn't work and the gear is going back.details:We recently took the plunge and set up fast internet in the house (averages 120mps download speed UPSTAIRS, a long way from the existing router); however, the Netgear router signal was a little sketchy in the back of the house (it would drop to 25-65mps) where we have a home office. So, I convinced my family that we should test this new and highly rated mesh-network system.set upWe loved unboxing and setting up the Eero 3-pack: it was a great experience. Well, done Eero team! I wish you guys were in charge of everything internet-connected we have to set up in our home.installationSet-up was a breeze and we followed the instructions carefully to place the three Eero boxes were they would perform best.performanceHowever, the mood then turned somewhat discouraging, when we discovered that while we were sitting IN the actual room with the modem and the 'mothership' Eero device, the top speeds immediately dropped from 128mps to 50-58mps while we were only 2 feet away and (of course) had perfect line-of-sight.In the office in the back of the house, the speed dropped from 65mps we were getting from the Netgear router to only 12mps, even while the second satellite Eero was plugged in line-of-sight with the Mothership, but just around a single corner from the office laptop (new construction; wood frame house). Upstairs in my office was even worse: speeds that had been 120mps/downlaod with Netgear plummeted to so slow that I couldn't even run Ookla Speedtest; the Ping test wouldn't even load! Good god. We tried moving the device to right next to the iMac, to the top of the file cabinet. but, essentially, I'd lost all 'workable' connection.the endI can't tell you how much I hate the ugly Netgear box (and all other boxes like this) but I guess you can guess how much: $499.00 worth of 'get this thing out of my house'. And I really like the look and user-experience of the Eero system. But, sadly, by the end of the day, after spending nearly the whole Friday afternoon  and most of dinner time with my technical son, and two other smarties-pants family members, trying to troubleshoot this system, we gave up. It was too late to call Customer Support and now: the weekend. After testing ~15 different positions around the house for the Eero devices, my family just wanted to watch Netflix and put the Eero system away. My son gave me a big hug, and said: 'I know you really wanted this, mom. It is cool, but it just doesn't work with our house.' Then he walked around, unplugged everything, boxed up the gear, and put everything back how it was. I know that I am unusual in having a system that already was working fine; but that's how much I hate the look of Netgear with all the are-you-insane-product-designers-or-what and their ridiculously brilliant flashing lights (as if we want those in our house; let me guess: oh, hmm, did engineers run the design team?).But, this is one time that beautiful design and a wonderful concept failed in execution. So back it goes. Maybe: it's a Comcast thing? Who knows. Well, whatever it is (and this is aimed at you, Eero team) the Netgear guys with their dumb design somehow figured out how to make the high speed connection work.Comcast - Motorola SB6141 'Surfboard' Modem - Netgear (tested: Eero, but reset to Netgear).22 internet connected devices: Nest, multiple computers, Roku, Chromecast, Apple TV, DVD, Smart TV, four phones, 6 iOS tablets.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGF7U62T5ZDP4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1X7DATHEV4VJG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"FLMartin",28-Jul-2016,4,"Not great for our business","Not great for our business, had to return. After successfully setting Eeros at our home, i decided to try for our 40 person business that solely does internet surfing (no video). Our business bandwith usages are less per month than a home with multiple kids that play online games and stream video. We used the eero in its recommended configuration where it was the main router not just a Access Point and while it worked with light traffic it failed when everyone connected, i was told by Eero support that each node can support up to 100 clients so we were far below that. Each eero had a hardwire ethernet connection to it to provide the best quality speed to them as their source, the main eero unit box just kept going online and offline and within an hour had to put our old Netgear R7300 back online and we were fine for the remainder of the day. We ended up using instead the Netgear Nighthawk X8 and all staff is happy and speeds from the one unit were similar as with 6 of the eeros, that was NOT the case with our old R7300 so from this test and particular use we will be keeping a single box vs 6 boxes. I find it very confusing that some of the reviews here on amazon state that tech support tells them that a user can have TOO MANY eeros in a space, Eero needs to work that out, we had our 6 spaced 30 to 40 feet apart and each was connected using their app. They are going to get a lot of returns until they tighten up that supposed problem with some firmware or hardware modifications.

It has been fast, much faster than our prior setup, and extremely reliable. I love the guest wifi setup allowing me to quickly test a one-time use password to friends who are over.

"Allen",24-Jul-2016,3,"Good but not great","3 star review because the price doesn't justify the value. If it was cheaper I would probably give it 5 stars but I expect top hardware when paying $500 (3 pack, comes to $166 per router which can buy a premium router with better range).  It uses 2x2 MIMO when 3x3 (communicate on 3 streams) is the standard for top routers (and laptops). It sacrifices some hardware power in order to look good and be relatively small.Eero is the best looking router, comes in a package like an Apple Product. A lot of attention to detail, simplicity, and aesthetics. Just like an Apple product it costs more than it's competition. It is very easy to set up however the app could have more features. It's perfect for a novice or clueless tech person with a good paying job. Nothing to think about and can easily add/manage a guest network.I have no problems with the network dropping off and I am a heavy user. The bottom of my Eero is very hot. No visible vents, I am hope no over-heating issues occur because I am cheap when it comes to air conditioning my home.My house has ethernet in most rooms, my Eero's are connected together via ethernet (through a gigabit switch). So they talk to each other through ethernet with my set up so I get fast speeds on each floor of my house.  I thought Eero's software would just make my life simple and I liked the idea of being able to control and monitor my network on an app but the app just focuses on simplicity and not features like showing how much data each device uses and other advanced stuff.If a new version came out that was 3x3 and perhaps physically bigger to allow for better internal antennas (improve range) then I would truly be excited about this product. For me it was just a waste of money.  I could have bought a router and additional wireless access point to solve the problem in my home and saved $300.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTD2421OTMTVM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A5B7D75B3MQFR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

The day has come for me to purchase the three-pack and give them a try. We are staying with our in-laws until our home is built, and their house was using three separate wireless routers to cover the home, with each one connecting to the modem via an Ethernet cable.  I replaced all the routers with the EERO units.  What a difference!!!  We have super coverage over the entire home and even outside by the pool!!  Though I am a power user, and slightly frustrated with the lack of ""under the hood"" access, the simplicity is satisfying (as long as it works).

We were using all sorts of WIFI extenders, even creating a second network using our electrical outlets to get wifi to the front of our house.  Unless you were using wifi in our bedrooom the signal was always dropping - we couldn't use on-demand options through our Satellite provider because our dvr kept losing the signal.I had been looking at eero for a while, but the price seemed prohibitive.

It also does provide whole house coverage and we don't have problems with loosing connection to the wifi like we use to. Setup and whole house coverage are two features it does very well.Here is where I am disappointed, the wifi signal is not as strong the further away you get from the main one like they advertise. I have a 150mbps plan with Comcast. The main hub that is connected to the modem, when I am near that one I have no problem getting the 150+. As I get to the furtherest one upstairs, my speed tests go down to anywhere from 50mbps to maybe 80mbps at most.Second thing is the app is very lacking in features. First off, I previously had the Google Onhub and that app had great features such as telling me how much data a specific connected device used and you could even change the timeframe to see different lengths of times. Eero app does not have this feature. Second thing is the speed test feature inside the Eero app is worthless. I will use speedtest.net app and get 150mbps result, go straight to the Eero app and get 80mp if I'm lucky. Sometimes the Eero app will do a speed test and tell me 15mbps.I am most likely returning these as the price tag is just way to high for something with less features than other routers and doesn't provide reliable speeds throughout the house.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28N3ACXTTDDD7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3EY4MOPV7XQ92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Greg Cooper",21-Jul-2016,5,"Had doubts, 3 weeks in, doubts gone","I had huge doubts when I began to set these up because the second one I tried to setup was struggling to connect to the first. I did a little reading and they suggest keeping them within line-of-sight of one another. This isn't really possible in my apartment unless I owned maybe 8 or 9 of them and then it would just be an apartment covered in eeros and plugs, not something I want. Fortunately, I was able to position it just outside of line-of-sight and was able to get them to connect. The following morning, however, they had disconnected from one another again which got me insanely worried but they did reconnect without me doing anything other than restarting the first one.However, since that initial hiccup, it has been unbelievably good. I was previously running a Netgear Nighthawk C7000 and an R7000 (separately across months) and both failed miserably. Neither of these routers are particularly cheap either which made it all the more annoying. My best speed with the R7000, which was the router I was using before switching to eeros, was maxing out at about 190 Mbps in the room where it was located. The speed instantly rocketed up to 290 Mbps which is faster than I'm actually paying for, no one tell Comcast.I purposefully get a WiFi spot check in various rooms before making the switch so I could get an accurate read out on whether or not the eeros actually improved my network reliability or speed. Here's some of the changes averaged out across 3 tests lasting 10 seconds each (rooms with an eero in them have been marked as such):Living room (eero): 190 Mbps to 290 MbpsKitchen: 110 Mbps to 200 MbpsBathroom: 75 Mbps to 145 MbpsMaster bedroom (eero): 15 Mbps to 120 Mbps (the original speed was actually a major reason I looked into eeros)Second bedroom: 45 Mbps to 150 Mbps(The remaining eero is located in my hallway, which I never tested before hand)On top of the speed improvements, it also allowed me to wire in certain devices which have rather poor connections regardless of WiFi speed such as a PS4, Roku, and Apple TV. A major improvement was the reliability of my Philips Hue box. Since I could now put it in a more reasonable location than my living room (which had no bulbs in it), I'm now able to use my Hue bulbs very consistently without bulbs disconnecting from the box.I've been raving about these to friends and family like crazy and I plan to purchase another three to really create a ridiculous home network with an eero in my second bedroom, kitchen, and maybe at the opposite end of my hallway (I have an T shaped hallway). You should buy!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23BVQ7LWCL20C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2G1UU113M7KVD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"A.C.",21-Jul-2016,4,"Eero does not support PPPoe, otherwise would be perfect.","I bought this set to use in Hong Kong where flats are tiny and have many concrete walls which normally block wifi signal. One thing I missed was that Eero does not support PPPoe while my ISP is using such setting, the only way to solve this issue is router on router.I went straight to Apple Store to buy an Airport Extreme and an Airport Express (thanks to the return policy) to try. I plugged in the Airport Extreme and tried the wifi signal, hoping it can cover my tiny flat. In the living room the speed was 90mbs out of 100mbs, while in the study it dropped to 20mbs which is unacceptable.Desperately, I used the router on router option for Eero and placed one in living room and another one in study room. I did the speed test again and WOW! 90mbs in both the living room and study room! It dropped to 70mbs in master bedroom and kitchen which is acceptable, but I can always add another Eero if needed in the future.Satisfied with the result, I took away the Airport Extreme and tried the setting with Airport Express, same testing result. So Airport Extreme is going back to Apple.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2I7JJI7JH7BSI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3D6KYIM3OQFPP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"Paynar",21-Jul-2016,5,"It Works","Love this thing. House is about 3700 sq ft and has some dead spots in corners and on back porch around pool. I have used the Netgear Plug-In Wi-Fi Range Extenders over the past year and yes they do work....problem with these is every time you move into another area that is covered by one you have to login into that extender so there is no smooth transition throughout the house. Someone recommended the eero system and after researching it I decided to take the leap and purchase it. It's amazingly simple to set up and speeds are improved, doubled in my situation compared to range extenders. I think it's a lot of money to drop down but after using it for a couple months I am very pleased and would do it again. NO switching to the closest extender anymore, just works wherever you go using the mesh network within your home. I have coverage in the dead spots and out by the pool. I have a Pentair pool wifi controller, WD My Cloud network drive and Sonos bridge all connected through a switch that is connected through the wired eero box. This was the only tricky part using the ATT gateway that is located in a not so ideal laundry room. You must have one of the eero boxes hardwired so I hooked mine up in the office (not the laundry room with the gateway directly) and it worked thankfully. Took a little work to reconnect devices to the new eero network (most people won't have this problem I'm guessing) and then everything was accessible.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNSQBX56Z3RNG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AXD0OTWDV7WJP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

We have heavy users (streaming video, game systems, multiple phones, tablets, laptops, DVRs, etc.) at every corner of the house and the three pack covers everything very nicely.  It did take 24 hours and a firmware update to get to full speed, but it took care of itself.  Running the microwave used to make every wifi device pause, but not anymore!A setup tip:  The quality of the system is sensitive to the placement of each unit.  If a unit is not getting a good signal, try moving it 6 inches in any direction. One unit had a very poor connection when placed behind a speaker, but moving to the side on the speaker allowed a full strength signal and full speed.A bonus - the most recent update added the ability for family control.

Works.In a big house with a lot of metal in the walls, I've suffered through many models of Wi-Fi routers, trying to get coverage in this or that remote wins and usually failing, even with repeaters (that rarely worked). So, the Eero system seemed very promising and IT WORKS. I do occasionally have issues where a device will ""stick"" with a farther-away Eero and refuse to switch to the closer one but this event is unusual, not the norm. I suspect it has more to do with the device's firmware and no Eero. Setup was easy.

"Amazon Customer",19-Jul-2016,5,"Honest review from an Xbox One gamer","I really don't understand what other people are doing wrong in their setup.  I purchased the 3 unit system, since even though I had fast wifi with a Verizon router (their top of the line router as of 2016), with two separate modem spots at opposite ends of the house, I still had dead spots that made no sense to me whatsoever.  My office is above my kitchen, and my wifi would be dropped by every device there, not more than 20 ft from the router.  I understand that this is through the floor... But should at least have decent connectivity.  Furthermore, my xbox was less than 10 feet from my 2nd router, and it would only show 2 or 3 out of 4 bars.  I would also get tons of lag while playing the division.  And to top it off, my TV would drop its connection when streaming movies from my computer.Needless to say, Verizon was not helpful.  They offered to sell an extender for $99, which didn't make much sense to me since again, the router was only 10 feet away.  So, I turned to eero.  From opening the box to surfing the net, it took roughly 20 minutes.  At first I was worried, since my 100/100 speed was showing up as 40/37.  But after maybe an hour (the instructions say it could take up to 24 hours to optimize) I was at full blast.  Please view the pic as a reference.The last test was playing on the Xbox.  I hard wired the Xbox to one of my eeros since there were many complaints about signal swapping with them.  the gaming had no lag at all, and I did not notice any sort of drop in connectivity.  Played for about an hour.This system is super fast, amazingly easy to set up, user friendly and has a decent app to go with it.  i highly recommend this to anyone with dead spot problems in their house.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RC4SPLN6POEAY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AI4WCI6SFKCYJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

Well designed, clear instructions and easy installation. Very significant improvement in WiFi accessibility and speeds throughout the house. One small warning: installation is a bit more difficult if you have a Sonos system. As I understand it, both Sonos and eero create their own private networks, and to be able to operate Sonos from, say, your iPad, you have to configure Sonos to use the eero network. Not a huge issue, but adds a little complexity to the initial installation. Once installed, you don't ever have to think about it again!

"Lorac",18-Jul-2016,5,"EERO 3-pack is great for a 5,000 s.f. home -- dead zones completely eliminated","The eero has changed everything in our household.  We have a 5,000 square foot home with 3 floors to cover.  The house is long and the cable modem and old router were in the office at the furthest end of the house.  We used high-quality updated routers with after-market antennas yet we still could not keep a decent enough signal at the opposite end of the main floor to run a webcam in the dining room (furthest point from router in office).  In addition we couldn't get adequate signal upstairs or in the basement.  With 10 ft. ceilings it made the distance to upstairs even further.  In the basement only one room directly under the router could get a decent signal.  eero has changed everything for us with respect to multiple dead zones and signal strength.  We used a 3-pack of EERO on the main floor only.  One where the old router was located at one end of the house, another in near the middle of the main floor and the third at the other end (dining room) of the main floor.  The signal strength is so good now we can use any wireless device, including phones, cameras, Hue lights and computers consistently on the main floor.  But.... what we didn't necessarily expect is that with these 3 units spread across the main floor the signal strength is good enough to cover the entire second floor as well as the entire basement.  I checked all areas using the WiFi Analyzer app on my android phone.  We even have signal strength in the garage to install a wifi security camera there as well.  Now we can use an iPad in the basement living room.  We can use any device in the bedrooms upstairs.  This product is extremely easy to set-up.  All you do is plug the first one in and do what your phone app tells you to do to set up the other two units.  It helps you place them appropriately.  We aren't using all features yet, but we plan to give priority to our OOMA voip telephone (also connected via wifi) so voice traffic gets priority over other traffic.  The units look nice on top of furniture or a desk.

I bought this product with the hopes of having good wifi around my pool and that I could put Sonos speakers (that run on wifi) in my gazebo by my pool.  It works better than I could've ever imagined.  My previous setup had spotty reception at the back door.  Now I have full bars consistently on the other side of my pool (probably 50 ft from the back door). I was able to setup Sonos speakers out there and it works like a charm.The setup for this is about as easy as it gets. You might have to play with it a little bit once you get it setup with the placement of each Eero for maximum performance, but you could probably put them anywhere and it would work great. I tried them in a couple of different rooms, they worked great everywhere, but some configuration seemed to work a little better than others.Yes, it's expensive.  Like some reviews will tell you, if your a smart guy, you could probably rig up your own custom open mesh network that would the same for a fraction of the cost.  But I don't know how to do that, nor do I want to learn...I just want my wifi to work.  I recently cut the cable cord and we watch everything over streaming internet now, so I was able to justify this to my self.  This cost is just a few months of savings from not having a cable bill.There's a lot of cool little features the app has too.  I probably don't know them all, but it has a built in way to run a speed test.  It somehow makes my wifi faster.  My plan is ""up to 25mbps"" and before, I would get a wide range of results from 2-18mbps.  Rarely ever 20+.  Now with Eero, 28mbps is the norm.  It has an option where you can just text your network name and password to others you want to allow on your network.  There's also a way to create a guest network, which i haven't done yet, but seems like it would be ideal for maybe a Fantasy Football draft where you could grant a bunch of people temporary access to your network and then remove it afterwards.I've had trouble with wifi for years and this was my solution...man I wish I had this 5 years ago!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1H0O9RUE2A9HB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1X9NS3WUPGJMU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

One of the anchors mentioned the new technology and how well it performed. Of course with any new technology there is some scepticism. I knew what I was dealing with currently and know I had to do something so I decided to give it a try. I purchased one to start and that didn't help, however when I added the second to place in another location to project the signal further it worked perfectly.  Testing speeds in various rooms at the end of the condo the speed was excellent.  So bottom line EERO does what is say it does.

"Jay A. Warren",09-Jul-2016,4,"Zero Handoff Wifi was my primary goal... and eero met the challenge","I had a specific reason for purchasing the eero wifi product... blanketing my home with Wifi signal so I could reliably use the Wifi Calling mode on my iPhone.  In particular, I wanted a system with zero handoff so I could move to anywhere I had Wifi coverage in my house without dropping a phone call.  And eero does this quite well.  I have absolutely zero cellular coverage at my home from any carrier.Prior to purchasing my eero system I tried many times to configure my many Wifi routers and access points distributed throughout my home.  Although it was easy enough to get less expensive routers to cooperate enough to work together, there was no way to accomplish the zero handoff.  Until eero, I consistently dropped calls as I moved from one Wifi connection to another in my home.By using a lan scanning program, you can see that eero uses the same SSID and channel number for the Wifi router and access points, and uses the same channel for all 2.4 ghz access and all 5 ghz access respectively.Setup is easy, but manual configuration is limited... although with the smooth automatic configuring to allow cooperation between access points I did not feel limited in what I needed to do.To sum up, I get very reliable Wifi coverage for my computers, smart home products, TV and video systems, and zero handoff for Wifi calling applications.  All with very good through-put, frequently maxing out the internet speed supplied by my ISP (see photo).  My only reason for not providing 5 stars is the system cost.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1C5ZXPS30N3UN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A30CIJPBH8JB5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Curtis E Smith",05-Jul-2016,4,"as many people would be more comfortable with a mouse and a full keyboard","It's a bit pricy for extremely limited security controls. There is no ability to manage it from any desktop\laptop computer. I strongly disagree with the App only approach to managing the devices, as many people would be more comfortable with a mouse and a full keyboard. The functionality is there, and switching from AP to AP is seamless. Overall it works as advertised, it's easy to setup due to it's lack of feature control. You really can't change anything other than the password and the SSID, so it's nearly impossible to misconfigure. The use of bluetooth for initial configuration is pretty intelligent, and made it much easier than trying to connect to the default IP address. There are no mounting brackets, so it needs to be placed on the floor or a shelf. PoE would be a nice feature, as getting the right length and hiding cat cable is much easier than dealing with a power cable.Overall I think the product is really good at it's intended purpose, which is to extend a wireless network beyond a single AP. Do it so that anyone can set it up, and have it work. They have covered those objectives. I think for the price they are charging, they could have added some additional management, and the ability to properly place\hide them in the home. Beyond WiFi that works, I really don't want to see the devices.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZ2KNBT8TWS1X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3RDN6PMWBY10O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

At first the network did seem to help bring a signal where it hadn't reached before but then summer arrived and real high temperatures in the attic space where the cable modem and the 1st eero device. As temperatures rose the wifi became very intermittent and unstable. Additionally while we have 300mb internet service from Time Warner Cable I couldn't get a speed above about 80mb. I tried moving the eero devices around to see if that would help but no luck. I took the eero out of service and reconnected the Google Onhub. While I still have a low signal in the extreme corners of the house I am able to get a strong signal in the main part of the house with wifi connection speeds up to 275 mb. My assumption is the extreme heat impacted the eero and degraded the performance?","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2XYJAQEOB1XY3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3QRJU3B5VXXD1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

I admit it is little too expensive, but totally worth it.The reason for low stars is due a backed-out refund promised by Eero customer support. They were supposed to refund $100 due to a promotion. They backed out as soon as I mentioned I bought from Amazon. They say it had to be purchased thru their website. First thing is I even came to know about this product because of Amazon, and went for it looking at reviews. They need to honor their promotion no matter where the item is bought, as long as I have a valid receipt.

"Stark",04-Jul-2016,5,"Fantastic product and company","I have never done an Amazon review before, but I wanted to share the fantastic experience I have had with eero—both the product and the company.First, the product: Not much needs to be said except that I now have blazingly fast wifi throughout my house. It could not be easier to set up. The hardware is elegant and unobtrusive, unlike the alien spacecraft that other wifi companies seem to be producing these days. Also, the eero model of constant updates and improvements is far superior to what you will get from other companies. My eeros have already updated themselves several times, with improvements in performance and new features added.As for the company, I cannot say enough about how great they are to work with. I did have some problems initially with streaming music services not working properly. I contacted eero, and they worked tirelessly to figure out what the problem was. The problem turned out to be related to another component in my network (not the eeros themselves) but they saw it through until the problem was solved. I now have no problems whatsoever with my network and in fact everything works much better than before. Also, unlike with other companies, I did not receive generic emails with general suggestions and links to online help documents. Instead, I exchanged emails with a single customer service representative who actually took the time to respond to my specific questions and worked with me until my problem was solved. For me, this kind of service and attention to detail makes the eero system worth every penny. This is a company that truly cares about its customers and about getting it right.Conclusion: Buy it, you won’t be disappointed!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R253A3EIDWMYK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A35J4FC328PDGR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

I had the eero system for all of 15 minutes before I had it out of the box and set up. The unboxing experience can only be described as ""Apple-Like,"" with the box design clearly able to guide the user towards which pieces to take out first without having to read any instructions. After I had downloaded the app, setting up each node took ~4 minutes, for a total of approximately 12 minutes between unplugging my old modem and connecting my devices to the new network. Once the system was set up, the app then proceeded to do a speed test on its own as if to say, ""See what you've been missing?""My entire life it feels like, we have been struggling with sub-par wifi connectivity at the far ends of my house, but no more. In a spot where I would have been lucky to receive 3Mbps down this morning, I now get upwards of 30Mbps, which is actually the speed that we are paying for. Until today, I had been telling my parents it's normal to only get 10% of the bandwidth you were paying for, because it was, but no longer!So far in my <1hr using the setup, it seems pretty sweet.

"dts",01-Jul-2016,1,"I bought a Mercedes and got a Fiat - Wifi speed down by 50%","We used an ASUS RT-AC87U router before. The speed was great in most areas of the house (usually well above 150Mbit/sec, in some areas which are closer to the device I got up to 260Mbit/sec).We used a single router setup which lead to some spotty coverage in the garden and one guestroom.The major reason why we wanted to the replace it was the some devices couldn't connect on a regular basis - which means I needed to restart the router frequently. Overall it was not a bad product at all and had lots of options/features - the price tag was $190.With eero and its $500 price tag I expected great things. I was thinking we are buying the Mercedes of the routers. I was looking for MAJOR speed and coverage improvements (means I expected speed of 150Mbit/sec everywhere in the house!).The installation of eero was simple. However, the app gave too little guidance of where to place the different devices.After the 3 device setup I saw that many features available in the app are not accessible - apparently I had to wait for a firmware update pushed to all eeros until they become available.Sorry but, every hardware device I have ever interacted with, is automatically downloading and updating itself when I first set it up.This seems very odd to me to wait until eero decides (apparently during the night) to push it to me, even though the firmware is already released and could technically be installed during the first setup.The whole setup process maybe took 5-10mins, which is great (I thought at that time).One major concern I have is that the device configuration is cloud based.This is great from a customer support standpoint, however from a user standpoint I have major concerns with that design decision.This means when your internet is down you CANNOT change your configuration. After the initial setup the only times I want to access my router configuration is when my internet connectivity is DOWN.I want to do troubleshoot the router config and decide if my internet provider or my on premise hardware is to blame.Furthermore, in case eero would be going out of business in the future this means that your $500 router is bricked.In order to configure the devices you need an up to date app and working backend server infrastructure operated by eero.If they bankrupt or a future owner after an acquisition decides to shut down the service you CANNOT use the product anymore.If no one will update the app anymore when Apple or Google make major iOS or Android changes the app is not working anymore and your device is bricked as Eero is NOT providing a HTML based configuration running locally on the device.When I started to test for speeds I was VERY surprised. My Asus router delivered pretty reliable speeds within the house of mostly >100Mbit/sec.With eero speeds dropped significantly EVERYWHERE in the house down to 30-50Mbit/sec. I rarely get more than 100Mbit/sec, even when a Macbook is sitting right next to the main eero - this is ridiculous (all test were done in 5Ghz). One thing which indeed got better is coverage and connectivity.Since my firmware was still waiting to get updated the support told me a) wait until you get a newer firmware (ok fair enough) b) wait until the mesh network is adjusting itself to your local setup.The next morning the firmware was not upgraded, but the wifi was simply completely offline. Apparently the main eero failed to upgrade itself and took down the whole wifi. After power-cycling the eero rolled back to its original firmware. I needed to call support again to push the firmware again (as I cannot to this by myself!).Support ensured me that all 3 eeros are updated right now. Later I realized that was not the case - one eero is still on an older firmware version which means I still cannot use all new features. Speeds also did not improve at all.What a mess. Its been more 24h and the setup is still not completed and I already called the support twice (by the way, the support is solid so far).So lets see what eero is claiming to do and what they deliver:1) ""Your router can't do this"" - yes, the mesh network is pretty neat and coverage definitely improved; however, the wifi speed is devastating.2) ""Your WiFi problems, gone"" - so far I had more problems than before.3) ""WiFi is no longer a black box"" - well since you do only have a cloud config and little to NON advanced features and options eero IS A BIGGER black box than before.4) ""Security that's one step ahead"" - I don't see any security related options or features - okay the firmware push is nice for the future, but that did my old router as well.5) ""Never reset your router again"" - so far not true at all.eero needs to significantly improve network speeds and features/options. Right now is has the feature richness of a $30 china router and is NOT worth $500.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YGCZIRZIDGON/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3NOC25C9NDL83/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"T. C. Young",25-Jun-2016,4,"eero came in a close second to Airport Extremes","I have solid experience in networking, and can hold my own in wireless networking technology.  I wanted to test the eero devices, namely to solve the issue of what is commonly referred to ""sticky clients"", or seamless roaming for my mobile devices when using multiple wireless Access Points (APs) in a home.  As my family is primarily Apple based, I tested with the following devices on my Gigabit Ethernet network, connected to U-Verse for 1GB up/down Internet::• Macbook 2015 running macOS 10.11.5 (El Capitan)• iPhone 6 running iOS 8.2.1• iPhone 6S running iOS 9.3.2• Macbook 2011 running macOS 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard)• HP laptop running Windows 10Overall, the setup and operation of the eero units works very well.  802.11AC performance is usually in excess of 200MB across my LAN or across the Internet.  The only issue I found is that my Macbook likes to hang on to the farther eero AP for sometimes over a minute plus, which would affect performance.  For now, I am going to use Apple Airport Extreme units to create a seamless 802.11AC wireless roaming network, including Airport Extreme at the head end as my router.  Although the eero units support 802.11r for Fast Transition roaming, the support of 802.11r, k, and v protocols really makes the roaming difference of my family's mobile devices ""work"" on the Airport Extremes.I will likely install eero units for wireless across my other house that lacks Ethernet cabling, given the efficient use of the second radios in the eero units for handling backhaul traffic as part of a true wireless mesh solution.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHHT2BK3AL9J3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1SELX77N3MHJ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

I am quite knowledgable in networking than the average person. Before buying this I was aware that the firmware shipping was 1.0, and I needed to let it update to latest before really testing this out. I decided that when I bought this, I would give it a week and see if the high cost was worth it. (I was really unhappy that I couldn't force a firmware upgrade, a detail that really needs to be addressed or at very least you update immediately when powering on the unit...) After about 24 hours, I made sure all units got upgraded to 1.1 firmware. The second day my Apple TV upstairs somehow lost its IP from DHCP and would not let me reconnect. It was working fine and overnight AFTER the 1.1 firmware updated and the units power cycled, it just stopped working. So I power cycled the closest unit to Apple TV, and it finally could pull an IP. Since then it worked pretty good for next 4 days, I enjoyed the range it provided but I noticed that the speeds I was getting weren't exactly going in the right direction. I have a 250 mbps internet connection and upstairs I seemed to get anywhere from 100-120. Not horrible, but my Linksys router I had before eero was able to get me closer to 200. I've noticed every once awhile I would see minor dips in connection speeds to my living room (Netflix or Hulu would just stop playing or pause for a second) every once in awhile. It wasn't horrible but for the $499 price, I was expecting better since this needed to beat my $200 linksys router I had before (I never had these pauses on the linksys in the living room). The last straw was now, my connected computer directly to the eero master just stopped working. I checked and it lost its IP over DHCP and it wouldn't work until I powered cycled that. I might try on v2 or v3 of the product but I just don't think its worth the cost when I seem to be having worse issues with this over my linksys","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34X046XYMOQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2UO8LXKGLF9VK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Ian Morgan",22-Jun-2016,1,"Extremely Disappointed--Constant AP Reboots and Instability","Absolutely worthless. Been doing the IT thing for 20 years and this is certainly a dud. I will say the packaging and setup was very clean and worked flawlessly. Presentation was superb--functionality not so much. I purchased the 3 pack for $500 and installed all units tonight. Wireless network and LAN came up easily. Then nothing worked. Then everything worked. Then nothing worked. The Access Points kept going offline and online--all of them for more than an hour when I said enough. The firmware on all reported as v1. It's silly to me that the first thing that the units DON'T do is upgrade the firmware. And of course there is no way to manually do it--or ask the app to go do it. So, I suspect a newer version of firmware might fix this, but I'm not waiting for the magical ""sometime late at night"" trick. Out of the box, the product does not work. I tried removing two of the AP's--no dice. All units were plugged into my LAN as well. Sure, I could have called support, but I'm not beta testing this stuff and I've never had the need to call support for a simple wireless AP setup. I've NEVER bought a device like this and flat out had it not work as soon as it was out of the packaging.

"Melissa B",22-Jun-2016,5,"Easy to set up and family profiles are a great new feature","We got this a few months ago and have had no issues with it.  And now that they have added Family Profiles, it's even better.  After years of incomplete Wi-Fi coverage of our 2 story home (2600 sqft), we finally have coverage everywhere - including the back yard.  It was very easy to set up, and all our devices work with it (laptops, Apple TV, Roku, iTouch, iphone, Nintendo DS, Wii U, etc).  The new family profiles let me manage our kids' devices individually, automatically cutting them off an hour before bedtime and letting me pause their access at any time.  I can also see all devices on the network and manage them individually.  The app is easy to use and I can use it anywhere.  I use the guest network for babysitters and other guests and can turn if off and/or change the password easily thru the app.  Note - Only issue we did have was the Apple TV dropping access, but we used a network cable to connect it directly into one of the Eero units and have had no more dropping.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RLMDS50C32R8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2WI587FTF8AQT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Jack Marchetti",15-Jun-2016,4,"Easy setup. Takes a few days to ""stabilize""","We tired many different routers, including adding access points or signal boosters and nothing worked. The router is on the 3rd floor of our home. The wi-fi was okay up there but on the second floor where the Xbox and iPads are, it was terrible.It took 10 minutes to install three eero units, and we were getting 150mbps almost immediately. Throughout the entire house.The reason I give this review only 4 stars instead of 5, is that it took about 48 hours for the speeds to remain constantly high. We'd go from 150mbps to < 5.  Support suggest constantly power cycling the eero units and my modem, which does help, but I shouldn't have to power cycle so often.It's been a week and speeds are consistently high. The eero units upgrade their firmware in about 24 hours. Most of the issues you will read on here and other forums are related to the very early release before they updated the firmware.It's expensive, but it was worth every penny.  Could we have probably found a cheaper and simpler solution, possibly but these are good looking and elegant and just work.  Reminds me of Apple in a way.I've attached an image from fast.com of our wireless speeds.

I would have to reboot my router every couple days as my bandwidth at the far end of my house lagged.I read the review for Eero and saw that it received high scores in two key areas for me:  First, I wanted something that was super simple to install and maintain.  I only need one feature- for the router to work.  Second, I wanted it to be super stable and not cycle between working well and not working well.  I can say now that the Eero is a perfect 10/10 on both of these requirements.

If you're looking at this review and wondering. Seriously... just buy it. It's insane. Works as well as advertised and is super easy to setup. I find myself doing speed tests just to confirm how great it is. I've had it for a month now and haven't had single issue.

"Jeff",11-Jun-2016,4,"Does what it says but still has some misses...","The Eero certainly delivers what it says on the box but for the hefty price of $500 it has flaws one would not expect for a premium price.Pros:If you are a person who knows very little about home networking and/or does not want to be bothered with the fiddly bits of home networking this is definitely the product for you.  It is as close as you will get to plug-and-play as you are ever likely to get.  You need an Apple or Android smartphone with Bluetooth to set it up (no Blackberry or Windows phones).  The guided tour could not be simpler.  Download the Eero app, create an account (free) and walk through the steps.  It'll even turn on your Bluetooth for you if it is off.  Start the app, plug in the Eero and follow super simple on screen instructions and within a minute or two you're done.  Rinse and repeat for additional units.  That's it. (Note: Once the system is setup no need to use Bluetooth anymore...it will work with the WiFi on your phone.)That's all there is to it and you should have seamless coverage in your home or wherever you are using it.  The units hand-off your device one to the other as you move about the place.  I think there is a learning curve for the units since when I first set them up the hand-off seemed to take a bit but a few days later I don't notice it. (I may be wrong about that...suffice it to say the hand-off works very well whatever it is doing.)Also nice is the system will auto-update its firmware.  You do nothing.  It just does it then lets you know it did it and that's all.  That may bother some people but overall it is a nice touch for most people.Cons:1) It gets hot.  Very hot.  My base unit (the one connected to the cable modem) gets uncomfortably hot on the bottom.  I set it on top of my cable modem and after a bit the plastic on top of the cable modem was borderline painful to the touch it had gotten so warm.  Heat is the bane of all electronics.  Unfortunately in Eero's zeal to make a slick looking unit (and it does look good) they compromised some engineering basics like allowing heat to escape.  There are no vent holes in the unit and the rubber ""feet"" it stands on barely raise it above what it is sitting on so the airflow is very poor.  As a quick solution I took to using bottle caps to put under the corners to lift it a bit to get better airflow under the unit and keep it from cooking my cable modem.  I understand they wanted sleek units but surely they could have done this better.  It is no longer ""sleek"" when I have bottle caps propping it up.  The other units, since they only direct traffic to the base, do not seem to get as warm so no bottle caps there.2) Each unit only has two ethernet ports.  This is not enough.  It should have four at a minimum at this price.  For instance my entertainment setup has several devices that can use the internet.  Not all are wireless and even those that are I would prefer to be wired.  The less ""chatter"" from multiple units in the same space the better.  With only two ports I had to buy an ethernet switch to handle all the devices.  With my base unit I have my PC and Sonos box and of course the cable modem to plug into.  Fortunately the Sonos box had two ports so I could chain it along but would have much preferred plugging into the Eero unit but I couldn't.  Three connections, two ports...won't work.3) The Eero setup a 5Ghz network which is nice but I have no idea how to access it.  I suppose 5Ghz only devices will get online but I cannot see how to use that network in lieu of 2.4Ghz.  Perhaps it uses whichever works best but it is not clear.4) With no external antenna performance is somewhat limited.  I realize this is a design choice and for me the internal antennas suffice but having setup other WiFi networks I can say that an external antenna can certainly improve overall WiFi performance.5) Their app shows a speedtest.  Pretty sure it is mostly worthless and only reporting speeds from the base unit that is connected directly into the cable modem (or whatever modem you use).  Using third party speedtests I get the same results when next to my base unit but slower (albeit still good) speeds when near the remote units.  Not exactly a lie but misleading and I really wish there was a way to test each base unit for optimal placement.6) No mounting options that I can see.  You need third party solutions if you want to mount it on a wall.  For $500 I would hope they would provide that option.All-in-all this is a very welcome entry to home WiFi.  I have been amazed it has taken this long for a manufacturer to make a simple to use home WiFi system.  My last routers were two top of the line Asus RT-AC68R units and it took me many hours (6+) to get them working right and Asus tech support was near useless.  You will not have that problem with an Eero.With some refinements this could be a perfect product.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SCBVJM8KDU6L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A31AHA1AP7KU09/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"Robert Freeman",11-Jun-2016,1,"I wanted to love this product but.......","I too have to leave a poor review.I am also a wireless engineer with a complex setup. I was using 6 Apple Airports to create a unified network in my home (about 3000 sq Ft)I have now installed 4 EEros. The performance is great when they work. Unfortunately they don't work all the time. And this highlights the HUGE problem with the devices. There are no tools of any kind to do anything to the devices. I can not easily troubleshoot these.I am running the Apple Airport net with the Eeros. (Very diverse channels - no interference between he devices. Eeros are on channels 1 and 36 - airports on 11 and 149). I reduced the airports to 4 units rather than 6. Yet the Airports, while not providing the speed of the Eeros as consistently, they have far less problems. The routers are connected to two Separate internet connections of 130 Mbps each and both systems have different public IP addresses.Granted I have a complex network. I do wireless cameras and home automation so there are usual about 40 devices connected at any one time. I have start remigrating devices back to the Airport side since the Eero side performs so poorly.Yesterday my son was having problems connecting in his room, (12 ft from the Eero). His phone (iPhone 6) showed a speedtest speed of 1.86 Mbps on the Eero net. My 6s was at the same time registering speeds of 60+ mbps standing next to him. Rebooting the iPhones, restarting the Wifi stack, restarting the entire system changed nothing. His Xbox One? Showing speeds less than 1mbps. Sometimes.Of course, since the customer is totally locked out of the router, there is very little that can be done. I have used external tools to do a  heat map of the system and RF flux density is pretty uniform for the Eeros. But the lack of any real tools to change any parameters makes this way too expensive. I understand they want to simplify this but locking us all out negates the advantages.I really really wanted to love these devices. I am out 700$ for a system that does not function as reliably as my old one. I am now stuck with hoping that there will be some automatic software update that might solve the problem.The picture is my phone endlessly trying to get an address from the Eero system this morning. Neither mine nor my wife's phone will acquire a connection. More work with little tools, this is so frustrating...","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CM5772GPYGFE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AO7MJ0AQIN0J9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

Only after multiple resets with pin did it somewhat work.  the other two units blinked for a while then invariably went to red.  also, one unit was extremely hot.

I will say there were less drops in remote corners of my home, but it was slower than my ASUS dual band gig router.

"Dan Kirshenbaum",10-Jun-2016,5,"A great mesh wifi system for the common man","I tried a million different solutions before finally settling on the Eero and I could not be happier with the result.I live in a 2000 square foot apartment that is two floors. The walls must be made of wifi blocking material, because I couldn't get a signal to travel further than one room over. I tried another more ""advanced"" mesh wifi system first, but I found that it did not deal with hand-offs very well and I would frequently remain connected to a more distant access point with a weaker signal. ThereI ultimately ended up hard wiring my Eeros to each other, but probably could have gotten away with using the wifi only. My internet is about 170mbs at the primary Eero, but I would only get about 70mbs at each of the other devices. I don't blame the Eero though, because other repeaters couldn't even connect in my apartment if I separated them by a single room. With Cat6 cable between them I get a solid 170mbs in every room now.*** Warning ***If your internet requires a captive portal you will not be able to use Eero. That means that if you see some time of login screen when you first connect a new device to your internet before you get general internet access, the Eero will not work. There needs to immediately be access to internet when the Eero is connected. My internet provider had a captive portal, so I currently have the Eero in bridge mode and use an Apple Time Capsule as my router (with wireless turned off). Hopefully this gets fixed in a future Eero update given that it seems pretty stupid that there is absolutely no functionality of the Eero when internet access is unavailable. What if Eero goes out of business??? This will just be an expensive paperweight if they stop supporting their servers. I think they should create some basic local functionality in a future update that works even if the remote management were to disappear. Overall, this is still a great product and solves an issue that many people have, but I hope they address this in the future.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1T4T2P2L3CMMT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A170C3Y5HR945Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

Since purchase I have only had one issue where one of the units kept disconnecting either from the network or disconnecting the devices associated with it. Either way, all it needed was to be unplugged for 30 seconds and it cleared whatever the issue was. Set up is actually as easy as they say and other than one isolated incident has worked flawlessly.

"Matthew J. Faulkner",08-Jun-2016,5,"Sorcery","Quite an amazing product. I have messed with WiFi for years, powerful routers, power line, repeaters, always in pursuit of raw speed in every corner of the house. My Comcast service provides 180 Mb/s and is very reliable. My issues were a dead spot in the back office, spotty Apple remote performance, a Samsung TV with a dreadful WiFi dongle, a Lenovo with a poor USB WiFi implementation and adapters randomly picking the wrong network access point. I guess after several years, WiFi cynicism creeps in and acceptance of issues happens.Coverage is complex, but WiFi adapter settings are Pandora's Box. So many, so different, so poorly described.I set up the eero network in an hour, carefully placing the devices throughout the house. The application is simple to use. Then I wait 24 hours for the network to be optimized (not really, heavy use of speed test). My initial tests were so, so. But in the morning, presto! 60Mb/s or higher everywhere!Samsung TV - rock solid. Apple remote finds the Apple TVs, Lenovo goes from 40Mb/s to 80Mb/s, Office at 70Mb/s from a spotty 30Mb/s.Sorcery.I am delighted to hand my network management to eero and so far they are doing a great job.

"Morris Rosenbaum",04-Jun-2016,1,"Understand the EERO WIFI setup requirements before purchasing","Not enough pre sales information for me to avoid it not working in my house. It setup easily but didn't provide fast and total Internet. I bought 3 only to find out that the design for use is based on all EERO monitors being within 40 feet of each other and having a clear view to each other. Anything less causes issues with good reception between them. In addition if you leave your current WIFI in place as I initially did, it competes for both the 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ frequencies and that makes sense but they don't tell you that in the pre-sales so only when you trouble shoot your issues do they tell you to try putting your original router in bridge mode. They even tell you the process to follow so I did try that several times only to find that when my WIFI was in bridge mode to the EERO the EERO lights turned red with no signal and me no WIFI. I tried redoing this several times and even had my cable company try it with me to now avail. As a result, I have disconnected and am returning the EERO system to Amazon. I am sure that if you are in a modern home or one where all EERO's can see each other they will work as advertised but in my 1940's Georgian home it didn't.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZ56QSJXBCO2S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A24U1PK50U4V91/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"drh3b",02-Jun-2016,3,"So far so mostly good","I like the concept of the mesh network. It set up pretty easily, with a hiccup, the first time it tried to register the device, it just hung there for several minutes before I gave up, backed into the previous step, and tried again at which point it finished setting up, and the next two eeros were pretty painless. All my eeros are connected to gigabit lan.I have ordered a 4th eero, two for upstairs, two for the basement, so as to truly blanket the house. The living room, which currently has no eero, ""only"" gets medium speed wireless-n, and with the 4th, will presumably get full wireless AC.All I ask is that you don't sell out to google, as that inevitably means that my $700 investment will be shut down within 2 years.Edit: Well, I didn't do enough testing before ordering a 4th eero, it is not really needed. I brought my Moto X down here, and it apparently transferred to a different eero than the laptop connected to, and was getting wireless AC speed. I brought the laptop back down, and it got wireless-n speed again, so I turned the radio on and off, and when it reconnected, it was getting 75% of the speed it got when in the same room as an eero, in other words, wireless AC, but through a wall or ceiling.June 5th, 2016A win for Eero. While my laptop always got full internet speed with my previous Dlink AP, my iPads and Moto X didn't. My Moto X still doesn't run at full speed, but it runs faster than it did. My iPads both get full internet speed now.EDIT 8/11/16I knew that eero lost it's wifi when it loses the internet, which is unacceptable in itself, but apparently, it loses the DHCP server or something if it loses it for an extended period of time. I lost my internet for 2 days, and at some point the wired network went wonky too. I guess I'll have to press my TPlink router back into service for DHCP  and emergency Wifi. I hope they fix this unacceptable flaw in the future, because I like it when  it's working. For the $708 I paid for 4 eeros, this is just a ridiculous flaw.

With this, there is no need for any of that.  Speed improved and the absolute best part is that we have full bars EVERYWHERE.

"Arnold Carson",31-May-2016,4,"Jury is still out, although mostly works as advertised","I've had these for about a month and the jury is still out.  For my laptops and small devices, including some NEST thermostats, the eero (3 devices) works as advertised, in that I've seamlessly extended my wireless network throughout my spread-out home and well into my backyard.  I initially had some issues with my AT&T microcell and this left me guessing -- was it because of the eero (which does not explicitly support QoS for VoIP or streaming) or something else?  The eero interface (which is only available as an ios or android application) provides little to nothing by way of insight into the internals of the network.  To that end, I experimented and ended up moving the eero to bridge mode and turning my Airport Express into a DHCP server and connecting it all via network switch -- and this did not improve the performance of the microcell.  Only moving the microcell as far from the eero as possible led to improvements in microcell performance.  The other anomaly involves my Roku 3 and streaming video.  Although speed tests routinely come up at about 33 Mbps, streaming a TV show or movie usually involves one or more (as in, every ten minutes) interruption to the video stream with a diagnostic of ""network error"" and little else.  Unfortunately, there are no tools available to provide me with insight into exactly what's going on.  However, I am currently working with eero technical support.  Finally, it should be noted that when you setup the eero, you hand over a great deal of control to eero incorporated.  Since the product was made to be as simple to setup as possible, the result is that complexity is now managed by eero itself.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31LLJRBVEOLKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AYNRCR89MTBS7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"B James",27-May-2016,1,"Eero For Problem Houses: The Dissapointing Reality","I was excited to try Eero, as the product seemed like a potential solution to my family's ongoing WiFi problem. Our house is very large, and the walls are a unique build and are especially dense. So far, the only solution that has worked well has been a network of Apple AirPort Extreme towers around the house. This has produced a semi-reliable signal; but with little speed consistency. However, the main goal was to improve the WiFi signal in the family room for streaming purposes and Eero seemed like a a good shot.Before installing, I tested speeds in three rooms as scientifically as possible. We were getting 100mps download speeds in the room with the modem and 50mps in the family room (not far away, but several thick walls in between). Not great, but livable. I then unpacked Eero (beautifully designed and packaged, and very easy to install) and set up the three in the same configuration as the three AirPort Extreme towers we had been using. I then performed the speed test again. Sadly, Eero could not live up to their claim to improve WiFi in problem houses. The speeds in both rooms had slowed to a crawl, with 5mps speeds in the family room and 8mps speeds in the modem room. I tested for a while, but no change. As soon as I plugged the Apple towers back in, we were at 50mps again.In a fight between Apple AirPort Extreme and Eero for signal strength in problem houses, Eero looses badly. I would suggest the company removes mention of the product's use in houses with WiFi issues, as it is not yet powerful enough to address these. Living in a regular home with standard walls, I would absolutely buy Eero again. The product and experience is great, but stick with Apple towers if you have very thick walls in your house.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3V6PPZ8RT9XG5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1Y0AS6I1FA0XT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Doug",24-May-2016,5,"eero is a homerun solution","I installed this eero (pack of 3 unit) combo mesh system as soon as I received them via Amazon Prime. Because I was also installing Comcast 150mbps Internet service the next day and until installed , I continued to use the slower att DSL solution that day with these new units with a WiFi ssid already configured to my own desired WiFi IDs/passwords. Then using these eero units, I just power cycled then reconnected to the nice/simple Netgear cable modem(CM600-100NAS) I ordered at the same time as I ordered these eero units, just changing a the 10BaseT cable from the att gateway to new Comcast modem when Comcast lit up the service the following day at my house.With the Comcast service, I wanted better WiFi coverage than supplied by any Comcast gateway integrated router. Plus I did-not want to lease any cablemodem/routher wifi equipment from Comcast (ROI of providing myself less than a year).  It seemed like the eero was a possible clean solution, providing better wifi coverage than available using the gateways provided under lease from my ISP (Comcast).The eero packaging was very clean and well marked for ""how to install"" and the iPhone application to do the actual set-up was surprisingly very simple to use. After installing the initial set of eero's with full success, I decided to get fancy as I wanted to get ""5 bars of coverage"" everywhere in a rather large home footprint along with a separate detached storage area/building, so I ordered a 2nd set of eeros to expand my newly installed wifi mesh network.After expanding my eero mesh network, all went well again except some results with speedtest.net were more inconsistant than before my eero added expansion. To understand what was going on I rang a call into the eero support line (link to call right on the Iphone eero application(and iphone application easy to use, configure ssids/passwords, adding a guest network, etc). This support call I made is where eero really shined because:A gentleman named Dave answered the phone at the eeros support number. Dave was not just a phone agent answering and reading from a script. Rather, he was obviously a well educated/experienced IT networking professional with good customer support skills. After reviewing my home network configuration and my concerns, Dave ran a performance test between my eeros and while doing so answered my many rather detailed questions (I'm ""retired from IT"") with accuracy which I really appreciated. The quality of Dave's efforts working with me by phone was superb. It turns out I had two erros closer than need be, and in the end Dave's time with me over the phone assisted me in tuning this new eeros mesh network perfectly.  It's been flawless since.In addition, as a side benefit of the eero design: each remote eero in the mesh network provides a spare 10BaseT port that can be used to connect a hardwired device (TV, PC, switch, etc) if desired, or be used, if a hardwired network is available, as a ""backhaul"" to the erro that is plugged into the cable modem.So bottom line, eero provided me a perfect homerun solution.Doug","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RED2HT4E9F1IO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AFSRV4A3WCK9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Cranky Old Nerd",19-May-2016,4,"I was not very happy with the performance in that mode in my 2800 ...","I am cautiously optimistic.I have had significant performance problems trying to get some speed out of my 300MB TWC connection.  I recently went to a Mikrotik Wifi hotspot which allowed me full control over it, but I was never able to get any device even sitting on top of the hotspot above 30 - 50Mb/s, and Mikrotik support is by design rather limited without an expensive subscription and I was unable to get any help from the community to fix it.I initially had pre-ordered these back in March 2015 but by August the routers I bought the Mikrotiks to replace had failed and the device wasn't ready, so I always knew about them and came back in May 2016 and found them ready to ship so I ordered a three pack.Initially I wasn't aware I could plug them all into Ethernet and had them in the wireless extension mode.  I was not very happy with the performance in that mode in my 2800 square foot two story home.  The upstairs suffered as there was no line of site between the hosts.Once I figured out it was OK to plug each Eero into a wired port I re-installed those two devices connected to ethernet and now I find performance is really acceptable.  My iMac 2012 with 802.11n (no AC) is getting 150MB/s using Netflix's new fast.com speed test.  My 802.11ac MacBook is getting 280 Mbps.  The iOS devices easily hit 100Mb/s.I use a physical firewall device (pfsense 4860) as well so these devices are in bridged mode to my own router.  I prefer this as I get more control/visibility on what is going on with my network.I have roughly 30 - 35 devices of various types (Gaming Machines, Laptops, Desktops, multiple iPad / iPhones, Nest, Dish Hopper, etc) connected and have had no issues with any of them connecting up and performing.So I'm cautiously optimistic.

"Mike M",16-May-2016,1,"Unreliable, Seems like a paid beta program","I had extremely high hopes for Eero. I dove in after reading all the great reviews. I originally purchased it for a small office, 10-20 users with a 300/75 fiber connection. Setup was super simple, I connected my first Eero directly to my fiber modem. After setting the eero to bridge mode, the first speed test was stellar. I proceeded adding the next two eeros, all three were hardwired. After adding the second and third I began to experience connectivity issues with our internet. Even bypassing the eeros, I still had issues that forced me to reboot my fiber modem. After reading through reviews and online forums, I found that my version might be the culprit (1.0) as other users reported similar behavior.I took the eeros home to test without disturbing others. I have a 1 gig fiber connection at home with Cat 6 wiring throughout. I tried connecting the eeros via hardware at first. They all came up for about 5 minutes and then started losing connection. There was no rhyme or reason to which eero was losing connection and it seemed to take my overall connection down...I couldn't even access internet through my Apple Airport (also in bridge mode). I reset the devices and tried again without hardwiring the second and third eeros....but I got the same results. Newer firmware is available that might solve the issue, but you are not able to force a firmware update. Instead, updates are done late at night and/or early in the morning. The idea of $500 worth of gear that can't be updated on-demand combined with the fact they were so buggy....ruined my experience.

"James Nguyen",15-May-2016,5,"Measurably improved speeds up and downstream over Netgear R7000","Three pack eero replacing a home network with a Netgear R7000 router plugged directly into our FIOS modem, from there were 3 ethernet over power line connections (mixture of Netgear and D-Link) to reach problematic spots for wi-fi reception and in one case, a device that required an ethernet connection, and finally, one Netgear AC750 wireless repeater.  All in all, the stuff all worked, my devices were online, and on the whole, happy.  It wast just simply a lot of stuff to maintain, especially with the odd event like a power outage causing me to have to at times connect/re-connect things, reboot, diagnose, etc.Save for one  powerline adapter for the one device that requires a hardwire, everything above is replaced with the three eeros and I couldn't be happier......so far.  I feel I need to keep that caveat in place for the time being.  The system has been in place for several days and has worked w/o a hitch (more on that below) whereas the system it replaced has been cobbled together over years and again, mostly did the job well.Setup was super easy and guided by the app.  I did encounter a slight hiccup on the installation of the first eero as it seemingly required my phone to have an internet connection to be able to proceed w/ the installation wizard.  Problem is that I live in a remote hilltop setting and reliable 3G/4G isn't a given and as such, the wizard crapped out a couple times.  Some awkward positioning of my body with my phone near a window got the phone online and a 3rd run of the wizard breezed through in seconds.  From there, the first eero was pumping out an internet connection that made the addition of the next two devices super quick.Network speed tests bear out very noticeable improvements, both upstream and downstream for my Southern CA based FIOS service (formerly Verizon, now Frontier).Prior to this, using my Macbook Pro and Speedtest.Net, downstream speeds averaged around 85 Mb/s give or take 5 Mb/s.  With the eeros, I've been getting very consistent 100-103 Mb/s.  Upstream has been eye opening.  Previous to this, with my Netgear R7000, upstream averaged 30 Mb/s, give or take 5 Mb/s.  With the eeros in place, I have seen ranging from 107 to 118 (!!!) Mb/s.  This has been consistently tested w/ the same laptop and the same speed test from various parts of the home with no noticeable differences from tests run from any part of the home from another.Perhaps there were configuration errors on my Netgear, but other than the DNS provider and admin password, everything on the machine was left stock.  I'm a fairly technical guy and the Netgear UI (scarily amongst the better ones out there) was so crappy and daunting that I dared not mess with anything.  The eero seemingly has a ton less capability in the app, but if I were being honest with myself, I wasn't using those features on the Netgear either-- e.g. DMZs, QoS, etc.  It would be nice to see more and more advanced features rolled out in the future, but I really don't feel like I'm giving up much.  ESPECIALLY when taking into consideration the reduced footprint of networking gear I have deployed, the fact that the units themselves are far less bulky and eye catching (in a bad way).  And factoring in the improved networking speeds I'm seeing on my actual devices themselves (and not just speedtests run at the router level itself), it makes my decision to swap over a total no brainer and absolutely worth every penny.  Many are balking at the cost, but factoring the cost of all the pieces I previously deployed, I'm fairly sure they surpass the cost of this 3 pack.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1E0HFTXNNC5GW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A39STTBZPJUYMC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Kiamat",14-May-2016,5,"Simple.  Effective.  But, Maybe A Little Too Simple.","The Eero does exactly what it says on the box:  Strong Wifi everywhere in your house. But...Let me just say right now: If you're using smart home devices like WeMo, Wink, Echo, etc, they WILL NOT WORK WITH THE EERO.That's because most (if not all, currently) Wifi based smart home products require a 2.4Ghz signal.  The Eero automatically switches back and forth between 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz signals meaning your smart home devices will randomly stop working.  I've switched my old Asus router to pass through mode--it only exists on the network now to maintain the smart home and wired devices.Simple.The Eero is far and away one the easiest routers I've ever set up.  The only one easier, in my experience, is Google's OnHub line.  I have an Eero on each floor of my house, and I am never out of signal range--even across the street!  I put one of them behind my wall mounted TV so that I could connect the TV and my Shield Android TV box via Ethernet.Too Simple.It took me forever to figure out why my Echo wouldn't stay connected--that's because it doesn't say anywhere in the documentation that the system hops back and forth between 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz.  Also, there's only two Ethernet ports on each device so I hope you don't have a lot of Ethernet connected devices on your network.  (I have the Arlo receiver, a NAS, and my computer.)  There is very, very little you can do with the app, too.This system is for people who's gadgets all live on Wifi, for whom normal routers aren't cutting it, who aren't interested in tweaking any but the most basic router settings, and who don't have Wifi smart home devices.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OGYM4DBUOAB0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3U1XQDDKVZU92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Christopher Halcrow",14-May-2016,1,"Incredibly disappointed and frustrated with eero","Incredibly disappointed and frustrated with eero. To be honest, i find it impossible to believe the reviews are from actual users. Purchased a set of 3, got them home and setup. The simple setup took 3.5 hours before i could get the eeros to speak with each other. I ended up with 2 eeros in places i didn't want them in order to complete the installation (poor signal quality - i saw that message at least a dozen times). I even tried wiring the other two eeros into our ethernet but this didn't help - they still need to communicate with each other. I finally got them working on Saturday. The connection did seem stable but the speed 12 feet from the third one (setup in my office) than i got in my office with a singe Asus router 2 flights up. The next day i checked the phone app and one of the eeros showed a red exclamation mark. Bad. I attempted for 2 more hours to set that up in the location (or at least near) that it was originally in. That failed. Finally i moved that eero up to the room outside where the main eero was. Nope. No go. Poor signal quality. From 8 feet away though an open door. Finally I gave up and reboxed and am returning. Perhaps i got a bad one, perhaps one failed. Who knows. What i can say is that the online support is close to useless. That the app is dumbed down to the point of no useful feedback (example: ethernet interface tells you the mac address but does not advise whether or not traffic is flowing, can't update - mine arrived with a 3 revision old firmware that i had to wait for them to update overnight, no actual read on signal strength to aid in placement) and the the coverage they offer seems no better than one good router and the speed is worse.

"Bryan",13-May-2016,5,"Replaced Airport Extreme. Work great as hardwired access points. Devices roam seamlessly between units. Very easy to setup.","I just recently received a gigabit internet connection from my ISP (Suddenlink) and was looking to replace a single Airport Extreme with something that would give me good coverage throughout my single story, 1900 sq. ft. home. I initially tried to use a second Airport Extreme in a roaming setup, but my devices simply wouldn't ever connect to the stronger signal when moving around the house. After reading the reviews on the Eero, I decided to give them a shot.The devices themselves are certainly aesthetically pleasing and unobtrusive, although I could say the same for my Airports. This was critical as my wife would not be happy with anything unsightly in various rooms around the house. Setup was fairly quick and easy. Just as advertised, the mobile app gets the devices up and running. I had a small hiccup and initially thought it was the fault of the Eeros, but turned out to be a problem with my MoCA setup. Once I ironed out the issue with my wiring, the devices have worked very well. I've found with my particular setup, it's most advantageous to use the units in bridge mode and allow my ISP-provided cable modem/router to handle the routing duties.Our devices roam from unit to unit seamlessly. We're mostly an Apple household with iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, iMacs and AppleTVs, but we've also got a Nest thermostat, Xbox One, PS4, Circle, Hue and other devices on the network. So far, there have been no issues and the devices I have that have AC wireless capabilities are getting pretty close to the same speeds on speedtest.net that my gigabit ethernet devices are.I should also note that each of the three units I have are acting as hardwired access points as I have one unit plugged directly into my cable modem, another unit hardwired by CAT 6 ethernet and the third unit hardwired over MoCA 2.0/coax. I have not attempted to use these in strictly wireless mode, which I'm sure is what most people will use them in. My main concern was roaming and these work perfectly in that regard.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3O0Z5XRG2WHD9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1G6UCT1CIK1SW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"Michael",12-May-2016,5,"Fantastic. I live in a 4 story house and ...","Fantastic.  I live in a 4 story house and was using a patchwork quilt of wireless routers, but still had dead zones everywhere, dropped signals and all sorts of problems.  I set up the eero system using 1 eero for each floor and it works perfectly.  The eeros are each plugged in to an ethernet jack.  However, I had to configure the system in a specific way that may be of interest to some of you.  The house is wired with ethernet jacks on each floor; they all emanate from the basement where the signal comes in from Time Warner Cable.  I had to get 4 eeros, and put one of them upstream of the switch that channels the signals to the different rooms.  Furthermore, I had to get a new switch since the very old linksys device I used to be using as a switch would not stop handing out its own IP addresses no matter how many times I changed its parameters telling it not to!  The eeros did not like that and got confused.  Once I bought a simple new 16-port switch, everything worked perfectly.There's another product out there called Ubiquiti Unifi wireless access points, but apparently you have to be a tech genius to set it up and the tech support is non-existent.  Avoid at all costs.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKQHZ5IGRRKBJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/ASWZJHX8IZAPN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

I work from the home, and the wifi needs to support lots of visitors, or just, you know, my kids on their devices streaming or playing video games. I got a quote for several thousand to run Cat6 (it's a complex home that would be challenging to run cabling in). It was worth spending $500 to see if it would work, and I liked the idea of the guest network for renters and the kids.I plugged-in the Eero and configured it in minutes. I had great coverage in the home immediately, and the network updated and self-optimized over 24 hours. By the time it was done, I had coverage in my workshop that's 30ft away from the main building. It's completely exceeded my expectations and made wifi as easy as it should be.This is my first Amazon review after numerous purchases, and for a good reason.

I also have a couple devices connected via power line networking. The main transmitter was able to determine which connection has the input from my modem and the power line network without any input from me. The setup was dead simple. It did take a bit of hunting to find the best location of the devices which the setup app walked me through. The speed does vary dependent on where I am at my home. I have a 200 mbs plan from Comcast. At the fastest locations I'm getting a solid 230mps. At the slowest about 90mbs.  Even at the slowest speeds I'm easily able to stream Netflix/HBO etc without any buffering or dropped connections. The network actually got much faster after the system downloaded the latest software update.  I also have wifi calling set up on my iPhone via T-Mobile. This has also been rock solid.

Now I have a 3 eero setup and a minimum 30Mbps in space I used to get 5 , and most of the house 230Mbps , the network has been stable for a month with no crashes. Eero has updated the firmware at least 6 times silently and constantly improving in the background with no interruptions to the network. This is truly something which simplifies Wifi and just works. I'm excited to see some more features for QoS and other aspects like manual ability to restart the routers , mac addressing filtering or IP filtering . I gave it 4 stars because it holds onto my network which no other router has been able to , a missing star as it does not have all the features which compares itself to other routers in that category","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YKMB0U8XVN5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3RPL60XAA28YE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Amazon Customer",02-May-2016,2,"Coverage is great but reliability and troubleshooting is extremely lacking","I've had three eero units installed in my house (roughly 2,500 square feet) for two months now. My goal was to get rid of dead spots in the back part of my house near the patio. I really did want to love this product - the idea of a ""self healing"" wifi network sounds great [on paper]. But in reality, it's utterly painful to deal with. First, the app requires Internet access in order to function - so you can't tell why your network is down, only that it's down. Second, you don't know how or if it's going to self heal itself - sometimes it did (but not quick - 5-10 min - and no clue what happened) and sometimes it did not (so I had to go unplug all three units and plug them back up in order). I emailed support and finally got them to admit their Internet-required app was not helpful (my words - worthless) and there literally was nothing they could do to troubleshoot the issue other than replace my eero unit (which didn't happen, it magically started working again). I compare this to the experience with my previous router ASUS Dual-Band Wireless-AC3100 Gigabit Router (RT-AC88U) that could tell you exactly what was happening (e.g. Internet is down so need to call Comcast) and only had to be power cycled in one spot (not three over the house). If it could reach just another 30 feet to the back patio, it would be a done deal - until then, I suppose I'll continue to struggle with the eero units and hope they improve over time.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2PBJW6R3YGAGZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/ACJVEUPLEQD1D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

The may as well be a Faraday cage. I have struggled to get a solid, seamless WiFi network throughout the house, using multiple WAP's. When I saw the Eero, i jumped on it, not realizing that i bought the first week of public release (and started with firmware 1.0.0). I had to get them in bridge mode, as i already had a dual WAN router providing redundant ISP access and Cat 5 cable run throughout the house. The first week or so was a bumpy ride, but support was amazing, especially for a brand new device. (One of the units was defective, replacement arrived in 2 business days.) Now I have seamless WiFi throughout 6,000 square feet on three levels.House 2: Basic rectangle with full basement, but no existing network wiring and the cable modem all the way at one end. Even worse, no way to run cable until i am willing to tear out the basement ceiling. After my experience with House #1, i figured lets give it a try. This system has the cable modem in bridge mode and the Eero as the router. Over a short period, the (Android) app has bloomed into a full featured configuration tool. Simple for a novice, but jump to the advanced sections and find a pretty robust set of management tools not found in many residential routers.

I now have no use for the power adapter system that I had used before, with many buffering interruptions.  Now I have no buffering interruptions.Since I wrote the above review I have added an extension to my house at the opposite end to where the Comcast cable enters the house.  My original placement of the eeros was line of sight use of the three to have a strong signal for streaming video in my family room.  When I added the extension to my house I added another cable entry point in the extension and purchased a modem and Netgear router.  I found that the router speed was far less than I was accustomed to with the eeros in the rest of the house.  So I took the middle of the house eero, reset it for the new modem and installed it in the new extension.  I found that my internet speed was three times faster in the new extension (85mps), while I suffered no loss of signal speed in the family room, despite having removed the center house eero.  My old system involved the use of an Airport Extreme router with three extenders.  It often quit for no apparent reason, requiring rebooting of the router and all extenders.  I have not had to reboot any of the eeros since they were installed.  I have a strong signal throughout my house and the only time I experience buffering is when my cable is at fault.  Needless to say I am very pleased with the eero network.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VB7IWR2H7UVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A9LUICPI5C951/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Eric Z.",25-Apr-2016,5,"WIfI That Works!","My wife and I have an older, all masonry house with an addition that we occupy a great deal of the time. I mention this as that was our challenge. Location of a singular router could never satisfy seamless WiFi through out the structure. If we located router in the original structure, the newer half was shielded by the impenetrable all masonry wall. If we located the router in the newer addition, then vice versa. We knew there was no single unit solution. We also spend a great deal of time in the back yard...some 60 feet from the house. We do not game, work a home office, and TV or video is limited to watching baseball...a lot of baseball! We are not very savvy with the details required to install our own mesh type system. So we were condemned to creating/buying a solution. We bought the doo dads that were going to boost, stretch, span, and solve all our WiFi woes.  This then that...nope, that didn't work. How about this antenna? No difference. Nothing that could be purchased and simply placed existed to solve our situation. Until Eero. My wife had run across an article in the paper (crazy, huh? Well, it was the digital version!) discussing Eero. I took a look and read/researched all that I could.  There were some complaints about the cost. It was a stretch, but I figured if it actually worked 50% better than what we had, then it was less money than all we have spent so far on a system that supplies very sub par WiFi!  Before we purchased the Eero, I rather whimsically sent an email to their support including a floor plan our structure and desires from the WiFi system. I nearly fell out of my chair when there was a personal response some 3 hours later! Whoa...people answer support email? Really? It actually contained details of usefulness on where, how, and why to do what.  I responded with another diagram proposing the placement of Eero units. They responded ...AGAIN! OK. I am sold. I will buy this! I purchased a 3 pack. I knew we needed one each in the two halves of the house to cross the original dividing wall. The third I would try on the patio in an attempt to send a signal to the backyard. We have a combined modem/router that we own. So first challenge was to log into the router and set it for bridge mode. Easy enough. We did have a limited amount of Ethernet CAT5 run through the structure. We set the first Eero (I like to call it the master as it configures things) in the newer half supplied by CAT5 from the bridged modem and then CAT5 downstream to our switch, both in the basement. We had previously downloaded the set up app and BOOM! We had WiFi in that half of the house. A second was placed (wireless) some 30' away in the older half, with signal fairly ""line of sight"" through a hall. BOOM! That half has WiFi! The third was placed on patio (wireless) and BOOM! The patio is humming! All worked flawlessly. We have some 14 devices being served. Even the Wemo works which had always been a persnickety little device! The patio installation did not exactly serve the backyard area as we had hoped, but we knew it would be difficult. In an attempt to improve this situation, I had installed a CAT5 cable from the switch in basement to the patio. We ""forgot"" the patio Eero and moved it to a higher location on patio and plugged it into Ethernet. After it found the network and was all happy, BOOM! We had WiFi in the back yard...some 60' away! Last evening we streamed ball game audio and and MLB highlight videos without buffering or glitches.  We knew that 3 Eero would likely not service all of our structure due to it's dense and awkward arrangement. So yes, I bought another 3 pack! We have not installed the second 3 pack as yet, but suspect these will supply the balance of house...with ease. To recapitulate: Eero works. If you would like a very simple network without having to learn all the technical details to build your own, this is it. We now have coverage at speeds that match what we are paying for from our ISP. I read all of Eero's site listing ranges, how to locate, etc. I can confidently and honestly say, it performs better than advertised. The signal is reaching farther than recommended. We  are overwhelmingly happy with our Eero purchase!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1H6W2DGVVIOKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1S8P331Z763CP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

I now have a pile of old netgear, cisco, apple and linksys products that have served me well, but are heading for the boneyard.Key benefits I see:  - much better seamless wifi roaming (for example, one 4500 sq foot home had 1 router and four access points and 4 SSIDs replaced with THREE eeros).  - much better wifi bandwidth in all areas  - management from the cloud (I can support all three locations from my iphone without being on-site)  - 100% reliability (it is early days - but no reason to reboot and router or device yet!!)  - FASTER than wired!  I have wired gigabit connections in all three locations.  I have unplugged all my wires to streaming devices - Roku and Apple TV and streaming quality ALWAYS better or equal to previous performance.  - ability to report on and manage the growing number of wifi devices in your home.  I have devices (PC, MACs, iphone, ipad, Andoid phones, Roku, SlingBox, Sonos, Amazon Echo, Nest, Crestron, WEMO, Philips Hue, Canary, DirecTV, iCamPro, HP Printers) - and eero is working to make the seamless delivery of improved quality bandwidth seamless for new users.  If your router needs replacement upgrade - your Nest could drop offline, your garage doors can stop working, your streaming TV can stop.  Are you ready to deal with all of these support calls as you bring everything online again.  eero understands this and is trying to make this all seamless, but if not - they have a crack support team to fill in the gaps.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZSP3EOR0QGB4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3LLWGTFUG7PJP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

I initially had trouble the first day after installing due to the out of the box Hardware having v1.0 firmware.  I contacted support that day and got prompt responses from Nick.  The Eero units all upgraded their firmware the first night and since then I've had no issues whatsoever.  The speeds I get on iOS devices and laptops throughout the house are amazing, where before I had a lot of dead spots and areas where my devices didn't switch networks.  I'm happy to tinker with firmware (was using merlin-wrt on my Asus) but the ease of use and simplicity of the Eero has won me over.  Clearly if you want the ability to fine tune things in firmware, this is not your option.  However, considering the quality of connectivity across our house (wired and wireless), I'm quite impressed.Unlike other reviewers who are using the mesh / hop approach, I have hardwired all of my Eero's as I'd already run the cables.

When watching streaming movies, be it from my server or the NET the unit within maybe 40' loses connection several times during the movie.  There is nothing going on, on my LAN to cause this.  All backups and general activity on the attached 7 computers are pretty much at rest.It's like something heats up, shuts down or off and then starts up again in the EERO.  The indicator lights remain solid, no flickering but if just left alone they will start to transmit again all by themselves.  No unplugging and replugging needed.  The times between freezes is also not consistent.It can vary from seconds to 15 minutes or so.I am bummed and considering returning them.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DD8J25K6BI8Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A28L4R1XR3C1J8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"gustav zantanon",22-Apr-2016,5,"So happy I bought this.","I love old sturdy houses. They don't build 'em like they used to. Unfortunately, in 1873 WIFI was in it's infancy. Check that. It might have only been a glimmer in Jules Verne's or H.G.Wells' eyes. Anyway, these days thick plaster and lath walls soak up a WIFI signal like Bounty Towels on a TV ad. Plus the floor plan of my house puts the Entertainment room on the far end of the house. To explain my inability to connect or the eternal spinning vortex of the buffering icon I have always found lotsa blame with 1-My Internet Service Providers (even switching companies in my frustration) 2-The content providers server farms 3-Poltergeists (I am waiting for the day customer service for the above will invoke this as the best explanation). I tried two different WIFI extenders. There was only a teenie bit of improvement. The second extender claimed to be using both frequencies, but no improvements.Then I saw a sidebar ad on Amazon (thank you for not using pop-ups) for a new concept in WIFI delivery for the home. Eero uses multiple devices strategically placed through the building to boost the signal. This time I read the directions before I started installing. But hey, I got excited, and soon realized I had plugged all three devices into power and totally out of order. While I was scolding my impetuosity, my Android (smartphone not the little electronic french maid* I also found on Amazon) told me that setup was complete and successful. My immediate skepticism is understandable (see above) so I do what I always do when my mother tells me juicy gossip from her neighborhood--trust but verify. I turned TV on, went to Internet content and clicked on Amazon Prime (seemed to be previously most finicky). To my delight, I watched an entire hour of the excellent series ""The Man in the High Castle"" without a single buffering pause. Yea. I am going to quit writing so I can get back to binge watching. Hope this helps*Disclaimer: To the best of my knowledge, Amazon has no current or future plans to offer Android Maids to the general public.

"Suresh Reddy",21-Apr-2016,5,"I came across eero Home Wi-Fi System while looking for a better alternative. I was very skeptical about eero when ...","I currently have a Sonic-wall Firewall which manages my entire home’s network, including the Sonic-wall wireless access points. Sonic-wall is connected to our Comcast modem which is in bridge mode. I have always struggled to get access points working on a consistent basis. They frequently drop out or slow down to the point of extreme frustration. I have a central control system with music, lighting, CCTV, and a security system with APPS that are controlled by personal i Pads and i Phones. So it is crucial for me to have a reliable Wi-Fi connection at home. I am not a techie and had to rely heavily on network guys to configure and set up my system. Over the years my family has given me an earful on the quality of Wi-Fi in the house. I spent $$$$ on the hardware and networking experts.  I came across eero Home Wi-Fi System while looking for a better alternative. I was very skeptical about eero when I first watched the video. I thought they were trying to sell me snake oil!  I called the customer service multiple times to make sure that the product was real and would work as promised. I finally felt confident enough and opted to buy a 3-pack on Amazon. It arrived on time. The packaging was reminiscent of Apple products. The units looked cool and chic! I hooked up the first unit to the Comcast modem (which is in bridge mode for the Sonic-wall Firewall unit), and I plugged the rest into regular electrical outlets. The first unit was configured and worked like magic. The other units were easy to configure also, but I noticed that the signal strength was low. After a few phone calls to customer service agents, I was able to replace some of the Sonic-wall access points with eero units. I converted all of the units to bridge mode. Voila! The units worked perfectly. I bought another 4 units and replaced all the Sonic-wall access points with eero units. They formed excellent mesh and the signal was rock solid. The download and upload speed matched what I signed up for with Comcast, almost 3-4 times compared to my previous set up. Now I am able to use the APPS with great reliability anywhere in the house. My family thinks I am an expert tech guy now (I want to keep it that way).  I wish I had these units many years ago. This is definitely a disruptive product in terms of configuration and reliable mesh formation. It eliminates the complex process of configuration and the need for a technical expert.  I have had this set up for 4 weeks now. So far I am very pleased with the performance. I have not experienced any drops so far. It also gives the ability to have guest access, which is a cool feature.  I think eero works best when connected to Ethernet. I did not try it without Ethernet since I have a pre-wired network already in place, but I am sure the units will do just fine even without an Ethernet hook up.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8MT4HP6PZ1OJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A251DR4JYZQR6K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Brian W. Nelson",21-Apr-2016,5,"Would definitely recommend","I just moved into a new home and was setting up my TV system.  I have Direct TV and two new sets, a Samsung and a Sharp.  Both were ""smart TVs that needed an internet connection to be fully functional.  But there was no nearby Ethernet outlet for a wired connection.  As the Direct TV guy was setting up the sets we could not get them connected to my home Comcast router even though it was nearby and had a tested 30Mbps download speed.  Just as we were struggling to get connected the doorbell rang and my Eero three pack showed up from Amazon.  Speed was of the essence so I looked at the directions and went to work.  In less than 10 minutes I set up the three units - number one attached to the Comcast cable modem,  number two downstairs and number three on the main floor.  I downloaded the Eero app and bingo the network was visible on my phone and iPad.  I gave it a name and a password and then tried the TVs again.  Bot immediately connected.  Not only that, but I could even stream 4K on demand programs right away.  Now the entire house has a very strong signal (there are three floors but I didn't even have to put one upstairs).  I am reasonable\y savvy and have bought and setup many routers and extenders over the years.  So far, this is light years ahead of the others both for simplicity of setup and for performance.

And trust me, I've tried a lot! In the Eero app, I am consistently getting more than 500mbs upload and download speeds. This is just amazing. But actual WiFi speed is naturally lower. I encountered 2 issues when I first set up my Eeros. First is the need for a US mobile phone number to create an Eero account Thankfully, there are online solutions for this requirement. Just google for it. The second issue is that Eero is unable to directly connect to my fibre network point because my network provider uses vlan tagging for the internet signal.

"TCB IN A FLASH",21-Apr-2016,4,"THANK THE WiFi GODS!!!","Four months ago I moved into a great pre-war condo in Chicago. The space is great, but the plaster/wire mesh walls KILLED my WiFi signal. I was previously running the latest gen Apple AirPort Extreme and even with another AirPort extreme operating as a repeater, my WiFi signal would not reliably extend across my 2,600 sqft apartment. I tried a few other solutions (more repeaters, moving the AirPort, and powerline WiFi) but nothing helped. I finally resolved to spend $2,500 having my house wired with cat6 cable outlets to spread additional wired routers across my place, but before pulling that trigger I rolled the dice and purchased the eero system. I have Amazon Prime, so I figured worst case I would just return it. No harm, no foul.SO GLAD I DID!The system took less than 15 minutes to set up and after just a little trial and error on where to put the devices, I had great WiFi across my place. No dead spots. No skipping video. My problem was just solved.Thank the WiFi gods!The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because 1) I do see a drop in overall speed in some areas of my house. Still WAAAAAAY better than before, but not nearly as strong as when I nearer the base station; and 2) the cost. Yes, it's cheaper than re-wiring my house, but $500 is a little high IMHO.I may EVENTUALLY re-wire my place, but the eero system is keeping more than happy for now.

Short of paying $750.00 - $1000.00 to wire the house with Cat6 this is the easiest solution.I started with the 3pack. They were very easy to setup. The first week I had some connectivity issues so I purchased a 4th. I'm guessing the issues had to do more with the fact of where I wanted to place the units. I probably could have had put them in other less than desirable locations and I would have been fine.I noticed that over time signal got more reliable perhaps the MIMO antenna learns where to concentrate its power in each unit.The eero creates a ""mesh"" network so your devices will seemlessly switch between units.Another excellent feature is that each eero has two radios inside one for sending and one for receiving data.

"milkofamnesia",20-Apr-2016,5,"Provides great coverage and was pretty easy to set up","Using a 3 pack for a 4500sq.ft.+ 3 level house on a slope. Provides great coverage and was pretty easy to set up. I love the fact that it works well with handing off the network connection between units. No more manually migrating between SSIDs or funny tricks to get a good connection.Great product!! Will be interested to see if they bring out bigger versions for even better coverage and higher speed. The concept is great, and these work really well with a little thought during installation.Do note that there a few things to keep in mind.1. Don't expect blazing speeds you may see with the latest WiFi routers. We have about 100Mb/s downlink speed from the cable provider. I have setup the eeros to be daisy chained, so on the lower level it has 2 hops. I can still get 100Mb/s over 2 hops on the lower level, but it does drop to 30-40 on the further rooms. In some cases it will drop to 20 on the far corners (still beats less than 5 or none with the WIfi extenders).2. Take your time to find the right spots for these units. I found it best to find offset locations on each level with the units about 35ft in a direct line with as few walls and obstructions between them. This meant that some corners in the house were further away from a unit. This seems to work much better than trying to find a middle ground between the dead zone and the other eero. For me it worked best to get the eeros closer to each other on each level and then devices are further away on the extreme rooms.3. Give it time to adapt. It seems to work best to put in the first eero, then find a good spot for the 2nd one and test the speed. Leave alone for a while ( few hours) and then find a good spot for the 3rd unit. In our case we set it up that the 3rd eero would connect to the 2nd to get the most coverage. It was still a little flaky on the most extreme corners and speed and coverage was so-so. Left it overnight and it worked very well after that.Update: August 2016Had some issues with one unit and had to return it. Process was very easy dealing with Eero.Also found that the remote units started to drop out consistently, which was very frustrating. After lots of troubleshooting I redid my modem coax connection to the cable provider, the speed stayed the same, but suddenly the eero wifi network was reliable again and all units stayed up. Additional bonus was that my connection speed on far away corner went from 20 to 40 Mb/s. I suspect there was dropped packets form modem to cable provider that messed with eero, but with limited tools hard to pin down.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MFEVK48PHUV2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1V8O4FT2VS5C7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"Christopher Jones",20-Apr-2016,5,"Works in Colombia through solid brick and plaster interior walls","I am a software developer that works 50% of the time from Bogotá, Colombia. They don't use wood or sheetrock in Colombian construction so my 3 bedroom apartment has solid brick and plaster walls. Because of this, Wifi has always been flaky in our apartment.  Symptoms of the flakiness included poor streaming from Netflix and iTunes over an Apple TV, dropped AirPlay connections to a Bose speaker, and flaky Skype performance. Since I work remotely as a software developer (*very* remotely), reliable networking is essential to my livelihood.Although the IOS app was straightforward to use, the eero node was initially unable to connect to the internet through the Cable Modem/Router provided by our Colombian ISP, Claro. After working with Eero customer service, they suggested we call our ISP to have the modem put into ""bridge"" mode. One call by my husband (my spanish isn't good enough) to Claro did the trick to put the cable modem into bridge mode. After that, setup was quick and easy.Now that we have it working, my network is much more reliable. Streaming now almost never has a delay. The airplay speaker now works reliably. My Skype connections back to my home office are much more solid. It's been a remarkable improvement.Although the $500 price was steep for a three node system, it was worth every cent to support my remote work.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OJZO435HKZ11/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2TENEMXA1TQL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

My system would not reliable see the QNAP/Twonky setup, and throughput degraded from 30 to as low as .5 on the higher and lower floors.  I installed five eeros throughout the house, and within hours throughput downloads were 25+ throughout the house, and all devices are able to see and manage the music on the QNAP/Twonky.

To register the device you have to enter a US cell number , even though it's unnecessary. The power brick is universal voltage, but apparently using it on 240v voids the warranty.All that aside, it works really well in my very old stone house with very thick walls. We don't have a great internet speed so that hasn't improved, but the internal coverage and transfer speeds have gone up quite dramatically.

"Gary",19-Apr-2016,5,"like a warm bath of fast, reliable wifi","About six weeks ago I set up an eero mesh network in my house, and my wifi system has never been better.Previously I was using the base station that came with my FIOS system, and it was dog slow and had trouble reaching the far areas of the house.  My wifi routinely crapped out when I was on an iPad or laptop.  It would have 3 bars, then 1, then nothing.  Even when devices could see it, the network connection was incredibly pokey and watching Netflix or whatever was dicey.  We thought it was just network congestion, but actually it was the bad wifi.  I also had an Apple base station I've had for years and it wasn't much better.I set up the Eero, and it was a quick proposition.  One eero station plugged into the FIOS base station, and three more are scattered around the house.  Now I have the rich clean bath of fast wifi all over the house that I wanted.  I never have trouble streaming HD video.  When one base station goes out, which has happened a couple of times, unplugging it and replugging it in has brought it back.Couple nitpicks - the eero base stations are picky about placement.  They cannot be too far away from each other.  they have real trouble going through more than one wall or a lot of shelves full of stuff. i want to put some on my walls or tucked away but they need to be a little more prominent in order to get a good signal.  I don't love having eeros sitting on my shelves but as I move them around i can find unobstrusive spots to put them in that still work.  Also the speed test that eero shows on the app is quite a bit faster than what speedtest.net shows on a laptop connected to the network.  Another nitpick is price.  two hundo for a base station isn't cheap.  But the configuration is so quick and easy that it's worth it to me.  I wanted fast, reliable wifi everywhere in my house, and i don't have time to configure routers all day, so it was worth it for me.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZBSUO5MRQS4J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AQ1LI1MFPO5AM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

Solved all wifi dead spots and all my devices automatically switch to the strongest signal as I walk around the house. No more manually switching to a different ap. It just works. I initially setup in bridge mode and left my Verizon Fios G1100 router in place. I was unsuccessful removing my Verizon router and using the eero as my router the first 2 times I tried. Customer service said it was a verizon issue. So after some research I found the issue. I had to release my Verizon Wan Dhcp lease before removing the Verizon Router. Do a search for ""release verizon wan dhcp lease"" the dslreports site has the procedure. Work the first time for me. Verizon sold Texas Fios to Frontier. No issues during the switchover on 4/1.  Now off to ebay to sell the Verizon Router and 3 old apple ap's.  The system has been upgraded 3 times in the last month. No issues at all.

"BB",18-Apr-2016,1,"I love what this product could be","I live in a house with 4,000 sqft on 2 stories. Getting good wifi coverage throughout the house and without dead spots is a challenge, especially when good bandwidth for HD video streaming is required. This sounds like the perfect use case for the eero, which is why I bought it.The first impression when the product arrives is ""wow"": The unboxing experience is very stylish and Apple-like. Next comes the setup. It requires to install an app on your iPhone; I'd personally would want the ability to also perform setup via a web frontend. When installing the 2nd eero, there is already the first issue: even though placed only about 20 feet away, it won't connect to the master 'eero'. It takes some fiddling around to overcome this. Next, I am checking network coverage through the house. Indeed I am seeing coverage everywhere, but bandwidth is poor and inconsistent. Even though my house has 75Mbps service, I am often seeing only 20Mbps or even less. This is certainly not enough for HD video streaming. I am educating myself a little bit, and find that the mesh network performance has been improved with recent firmware. I try to update the firmware, but this can't be done manually. I have to wait over night for the eeros to update their firmware. Next morning, 2 eeros have indeed updated from 1.0.0 to 1.0.9 - but the 3rd one got stuck and now shows a red light. Power cycling won't help, which gets me in contact with tech support. They somehow are able to fix that from their end, which I personally feel is a bit spooky. However, the network performance remains poor. I send about 10 emails back and forth with hero's tech support. Kudos, eero support is very responsive... but the problems remain. After one full day of using it, I discover even more problems: my MacBook Pro, located 6 feet away from the 'master' eero will only see 20Mbps bandwidth, when waking up from sleep. To fix that, I have to turn wifi off and on. Yes, this works, but this can't be what I have to do 10 times a day. Also, I notice that my Hewlett Packard printer will randomly drop off the network, even though my iMac, sitting right next to the printer, sees perfect network. Eero's tech support confirms both issues to be known. This is the signal for me to admit that the product is not working for me.Summary:* good:- nice packaging- nice appearance- great tech support- overall good concept* bad:- poor network performance- not compatible with Mac OS X El Capitan- not compatible with Hewlett Packard OfficeJet printer- high priceI have replaced the eero with a Netgear X8 router. This router is significantly cheaper than the eeros and a single access point provides more bandwidth and better coverage than 3 eeros. I love what the eeros could be... but they absolutely did not deliver on the promise. I am sure eero will fix that eventually with a software update, but at a $500 price tag I am simply not willing to wait for that to happen.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36PE71O3LL11O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2771DW2QJHVJ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Ronald Epstein",17-Apr-2016,5,"The Most Revolutionary Home Wi-Fi Distribution Product I Have Ever Seen!","eero has been the most revolutionary product that I have had the opportunity to review over the years.Due to the amount of raves I am going to put forward for this eero product, I feel the need to say the following....I have always approached my reviews with a complete unbiased opinion, whether said product was provided to me at no charge or I had to pay for it out of pocket. I feel my reputation for providing honest reviews is more important than writing something positive merely for the sake of receiving free product. In the case of eero, this was something I paid for out of pocket, though at a slight discount. It was a rather expensive purchase as I added additional modules, but done so with the feeling that if I didn't like this system, I could easily return it for a refund.I have been eyeing this product for well over a year now when it was first introduced as part of a kickstarter campaign. eero was being promised as a system that would bring enterprise-grade WiFi to the home thanks to its ability to create a mesh network that covers the entire home, eliminating dead spots and maintaining top bandwidth speed.Such claims certainly raised my eyebrows. I spend most of my day on the Internet connected to home WiFi. I prefer using my laptop over my desktop as it allows me to have freedom to work wherever I want within my home. This means I am entirely dependent upon a fast WiFi signal for browsing and downloading. I have to tell you, I live in a very large multi-level home where my WiFi signal is pretty lackluster. This is despite the fact that I have bridged two routers to repeat and extend WiFi throughout the house, and added several smart plugs that use the home's electrical system to distribute bandwidth. All this money and effort has improved Internet speed within my home, but nothing close to what eero has accomplished.You see, if you live in a large home, a single router is not going to be able to distribute a strong signal to every room and level. Up until now, your only choice to fill your dwelling with more ample WiFi was to depend on multiple routers or repeaters. Trying to set these devices up are notoriously difficult, often forcing the buyer to connect to their computer and dealing with complicated software instructions to bridge everything together. Even then, you face inconsistent Internet connections and dead spots within your living space.The idea behind eero is that it starts as a single Wi-Fi system within itself, that plugs into your existing router using an ethernet cable. With each additional eero unit you add, you are able to extend WiFi coverage throughout the home. All of this can effortlessly be set up through a smartphone or tablet app which allows you to secure your system and grant or deny access to users through that application.Of course, that's just a very short overview of eero. As I go forward and really go into depth about what this product can do and how I think it will dramatically improve WiFi in your home, I think you are going to be very, very impressed.eero comes as a 3-pack starter kit or single module units. The 3-pack is a great way to start a pretty powerful WiFi distribution within your home. Single module units can be bought separately to increase the coverage. They are also perfect, alone, for small apartments where dead spots exist.For my purposes, I started with a 3-pack and bought two additional single units. Even with a slight discount that I received, this proved to be a very expensive purchase. However, as I go into more detail, I think you'll find that the price was justified for the results I received.Each eero device looks like something that Apple would have made. It has a very sleek, refined cube design, with a curved top and no exterior antennas. In other words, it's beautiful enough to put out in the open.All the eero units are identical whether you buy one or a hundred. The idea is that they placed approximately 40 feet from each other for proper WiFi distribution. Each unit gets plugged into a wall outlet and has two ethernet plugs in the rear so that you can have direct ethernet connection to devices in your home, if you wish. Up until now, there was no way I could plug my laptop, smart display or Tivo directly into an ethernet connection so far from the main router. Now, that problem is solved.SETUPIf I told you that you can set up multiple eeros in your home in under 15 minutes, you would probably say I am crazy. However, thanks to an app that installs on your smartphone or tablet, the entire process including securing your own network can be done within just a few minutes. It is the most effortless procedure I have ever gone through in setting up a WiFi system in my home.The first thing you do is plug your first eero unit into your router/modem. Each module comes with a power plug and quality ethernet cable to get you started. It may be a good idea to check the eero website to make certain you have a compatible system. I have Verizon Fios in my home and am using the Actiontec router.Start the eero app on your smartphone or tablet. It will immediately find your eero device and prompt you to set up your own network -- even if one exists already. It is here that you will give your home network a personal name and a secure password. eero claims to be the ""Fort Knox"" of WiFi equipment so you should be confident the the network is secure. I'll talk more about that security as I move forward with this review.From start to finish, installing your first eero unit should take mere minutes. There's no configuring of IP addresses. No technical jargon to deal with. The app simply senses your unit, allows you to give your network a name and password. Done!Want to add additional eero modules to expand coverage? The app asks if you would like to do that. It suggests you place each additional module within 40 feet of each other. So, go downstairs or upstairs and plug in another eero. The app will automatically tell you if your modules are in range so they can talk to each other. In cases where they are not, the app will suggest you move the modules to a different location.I have a multi-level home with 5 levels that include a basement. I placed 5 eero modules throughout my home and had it all set up within 15 minutes or less. I ran into a slight problem with my basement module seeing the eero module on the floor above it, but with some careful re-arrangements, the app finally confirmed that the units were talking to each other.Once completely set up, the app allowed me to create a GUEST NETWORK in my home so that visitors could have their own access (via password) without my own personal password ever being revealed. This was something I was never able to figure out how to do with my router network that has been in place within my home all these years. The eero app made it so simple to do.The app also is useful in giving you statistics on your system's current stats, the measured bandwidth coming into your home, and how many devices (and which devices) are currently connected to your home network. There is a lot of useful information, at a glance, that was never previously made available to me. All of that information is kept in my pocket whenever I have my phone on me. I can also access that information from work or while on vacation. I can grant and deny access to anyone who attempts to access my home network. It's simply amazing all the things I can now do that I simply couldn't figure out how to do previously.PERFORMANCEThis is my favorite part of the review. This is where I can put real numbers to my claims that this is the most revolutionary product of its kind.Before I installed eero, I took measurements of my WiFi signal on multiple floors within my home. Even with a bridged repeater installed, the numbers weren't that great. I think you will be amazed at how dramatically those numbers went up after I installed eero.Before I get into the actual before and after numbers, I want to point out that I have Verizon Fios in my home. I subscribe to a 75/75 Mbps download/upload plan. eero is actually showing a faster speed coming into my home, and some of the measured results using speedtest.net proved those measurements.So, here's the fun part of this review. Let's go through a before and after of WiFi measurements throughout my home:The first measurements are for my upstairs hallway, a mere 12 feet from the original Verizon wireless router. I went from 12.90/12.23Mbps to 70.90/61.41Mbps. I should note that I didn't even connect to the closest hub to measure these tests. I configured speedtest.net to connect to a NYC hub which is 55 miles north of my location. A closer hub would probably have yielded higher results on both tests.Next measurement was on my main, living room floor where I usually sit with my laptop. This is a huge amount of space, and for that reason I opted to place 2 eero units at either end of the floor. Again, dramatic improved measurements as I went from 12.61/13.62Mbps to 62.12/40.65Mbps. I have taken additional measurements at this location (which I will show later in the review) which exceed 80Mbps with a WiFi connection. Holy Cow!On to the den level. Again, dramatic measured results as I went from 14.12/13.17Mbps to 68.85/63.66MbpsTo the basement -- the lowest level in my home and the most difficult to get eero to communicate. Yet, it gave me the most impressively dramatic improvement I could ever expect. Mind you, the basement door is always closed. It is where my home theater is located so there are many pieces of powered equipment. I initially had difficulty placing my module in communication distance with the floor above it. However, I went from 14.06/14.45Mbps to a whopping 75.66/89.63Mbps connection --- which exceeds the levels that I am subscribing from Verizon for wired service.If you look at the results in the above paragraph, I am essentially getting the same bandwidth strength via WiFi in a basement as I would a wired connection to my home router. That's friggin' incredible.Here's another test I ran: I went back to my favorite sitting chair in the living room to see what the difference would be between the household WiFi and being plugged directly into the ethernet connection of one of the remote eero units. I went from a WiFi signal of 82.61/74.78Mbps to a connected signal of 82.85/84.46Mbps. That again supports my claims that the WiFi signal that eero distributes throughout the home can be just as strong as your computer connected directly to the router.PRICE AND CONCLUSIONThis is in a category all by itself. There's a reason for that.Up until this point I am sincerely hoping that you have been ""oohing"" and ""aahing"" over the benchmark results that I have provided you. There is no doubt that eero does exactly what it sets out to do -- providing a mesh home WiFi network that delivers professional industry results in your own home.This comes at a huge cost to the average consumer. And this is where I know a lot of negative feedback is going to come from.The price of a singe eero module is $199. $499 for a three pack starter kit. My 5 module system to cover my entire home (and honestly, I could have probably done it with 4 modules) cost nearly $900.Could this have been done cheaper with some newer routers and extenders? Absolutely! However, I believe that the entire setup and maintenance process from start to finish is done better with eero. For someone who doesn't have the technical knowledge to set up a large home network like this, I don't think anything comes close to the painless experience of setting up an eero system. Additionally, since owning eero, updates are being pushed to my system automatically, during the night, to improve speed and performance. I have no doubt that additional features will also be pushed to the eero over the coming year.The fact that eero is so very expensive right now, is right in line with any new product of this sort. There is already competition coming from another company called Luma, who is also offering surround WiFi. Their system, as of the writing of this review, has not yet shipped. In time, the price of these home mesh networks will drop. It's just a matter of when you want to jump into the game. Me? I always pay the most to get into this kind of technology as soon as possible.I just want to end this review by saying I have never been as amazed and proud of a product as I am of eero. It is one of the very few times I have gambled with a boatload of money on a gadget only to consider it a drop in the bucket for the benefits I received. For my WiFi to be as fast as connected ethernet is just amazing to me.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWQ0A90R8JKJP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2MZZP3ZU9B5JS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"Michael Bierman",16-Apr-2016,4,"So far so good...some ups some downs but happy","My review of Eero wifiFor context, I was replacing three Apple AirPort Express units connected via ethernet with the Eeros.Pros⦾ Elegant packaging ala Nest—close to Apple but not quite. Portrays a quality product.⦾ Easy to set up.⦾ Easy to add additional units.⦾ Nice that RJ45 ports are interchangeable. Plugin which ever one you want.⦾ Excellent Speed. At times I get >220Mbs over wifi! Much better than the Apple AirPorts which only supported older wifi standards. I'm finally getting the full service that Comcast brings to my door.⦾ Love the way ports are listed under the mapped device. Makes a ton of sense.⦾ Remote admin—excellent feature.⦾ Build in speed test— another excellent feature. Nice because it tests from the perspective of the router out--not my device.⦾ Super Helpful support!Places to improve⦾ Port mapping: Multiple ports in one line and it doesn't seem you can map a range of ports. Apple’s AirPort interface is better.⦾ Once made, you can't edit an IP reservation!!! One has to delete and recreate the reservation if the MAC address is wrong or you decide to change the IP address. If you have done any port forwarding, this is needlessly painful.⦾ Port reservations should automatically default to the same port. You seem to have to set both yourself.⦾ Mac addresses have to be entered in ""nn:nn:nn:nn:nn"" format and IPs have to be entered in ""xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"". Geez, make it easy on users!⦾ How long does a DHCP reservation last? Who knows? you can’t see and you can’t change it.⦾ Copy/Paste for things like your IP address, Mac Address, etc.⦾ Add option to turn off Internet PING.⦾ No support for hairpin NATing.⦾ No IPV6 support.⦾ Hardware seems to run a little hot. Not sure if that is a worry or not.⦾ It might be nice if you could open a port without reserving an IP address (based on MAC address) but I would consider this a minor convenience for when you don't care what the IP is, just that a port is open.Updates⦾ No IP spoofing protection. It isn't possible to block IPs so external attacks claiming to be from inside the network are let in. This is a significant vector for attack. My Synology offers the option to automatically block logins beyond a certain number of failed attempts. This would be a great addition here as well but there are other possible solutions.⦾ I started to see some attacks that used IP spoofing to try to login to some security cameras. The router should reject packets originating from outside your local network that claim to originate from within.⦾ After a month or so using the product, I can say the connect is reliable and trouble free.I assume that a lot of the issues above will be resolved as they are just changes in the mobile admin app and can be rolled out easily to all Eero users over time.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3AKPQR48ADV96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3IFZ60NII5XNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

Just set it up for a client today and it was the easiest thing to setup. I bought the 3 pack and placed one downstairs in their main living room where the modem was (Ethernet), another downstairs in an office on the other side of the house (via Ethernet drop), and another upstairs in the middle of the house. I get full bars everywhere I go with one SSID, and you can see your phone or other device properly hand off the connection. No need for ""5G"", just one wireless network name, and poof, it works. Now there aren't any crazy network features here such as MAC filtering or anything. It's really basic in what options you have, but honestly it's perfect for most setups. However, if you do need certain professional features then you can always get a security appliance (firewall) that handles DHCP or static addressing and use the Eero in ""bridged"" mode just for your wireless network. A lot of people seem to complain about the price but guess what, if you buy any other wireless router, you'll need access points AND the wireless networks will have different SSIDs and won't handle the hand-off correctly for users. If you use repeaters... Well those stink and cut your bandwidth by half. This is totally worth every penny. The app works great too (I used it for iPhone) and I love the built in speed tests, monitoring of network, and ability to give guest access or main access on the fly. 5/5 would buy again. Definitely only using Eero in the future for my clients and myself.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RIRW9U7QY0X33/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A358JPUPLJYYHG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Bodacious Wonderment",13-Apr-2016,2,"Gave it the old college try.","Oh, how I wished this would have worked. Set it up, and at first it seemed ok, did get some speed gains to far end of house, but less than I hoped for. But measurable (farthest bedroom went from about 4Mbps to 10). That gain, plus the promised 'it just works' idea, made me happy.Next morning I woke up, wifi is down. I monkey with it, but end up setting up my old router then head to work. Come home late, monkey with it, can't get it to work. Next day I take morning off and spend an hour 43 minutes with (very polite, very nice) tech support. They determine that one unit is bad, promise to send one out. Then determine that maybe the other unit is bad also, promise to send replacement.At this point I realize I've spent more time on my network in the last two days than I have in the last two years. Doesn't seem to 'just work'. Plus - the units are way too black box for any kind of troubleshooting. All you can do with the phone app is hit a couple buttons and receive unhelpful messages like 'your eero is offline'. I don't LIKE to monkey with routers and modems, but if I have to, I like to have some tools.Two stars because their tech support was really engaged and they were more than willing to replace the units.

"George P. Burdell",12-Apr-2016,5,"It just works... Seamless, headache free extended WiFi for your home.","Over the past decade, I've tried various WiFi gear from most of the well known major network device manufacturers to create an extended home WiFi network. In almost every case, the setup was usually problematic requiring multiple attempts to get everything configured.  Then, once everything was set up, I was still left lacking with spotty dead zones.  Thereafter, I could pretty much count on one or more of the extended WiFi nodes to stop responding periodically, thus requiring either a reboot or worst case a reset and completely starting over with reconfiguring it.  Ugh!  What a hassle!  In the end, the best case scenario I had was 3 or 4 individual extended WiFi networks that I had to connect / disconnect between as I roamed throughout my home, each time experiencing a network bandwidth speed cut in half as result of extending the network.  Bleeh!Then about a year ago, while searching for a better solution, I heard about the upcoming release of eero, a new WiFi based on mesh technology. Since then, I have been anxiously awaiting for the product release. When I finally received it, I couldn't believe how simple the setup was. It was so brain dead easy. Within 30 minutes, I had replaced my problematic, multiple WiFi networks with a single, consolidated WiFi network. It's been  Now, I don't even think about my WiFi.

"Justin",09-Apr-2016,4,"Would have been 5 star, but...","REASONS WHY I KNOCKED OFF A STARReason 1:  No custom configuration of wifi security settings.  You can't pick the type of security to use, whether or not to broadcast, etc.  My old router even had an ""Allowed Devices"" option that ONLY allowed devices on the Allowed Devices list to connect which added an extra layer of security.Reason 2:  The eeros require the eero company to stay in business.  If this company goes out of business, the Android/iOS apps necessary to set up the device will be useless.  Also, the eero devices themselves have to connect to eero's cloud service which will be non-existent if eero goes out of business.  (They don't even technically need to go out of business.  Someone like Google/Nest could buy the company just for the technology/patents and scrap it like they did to Revolv Hub - screwing the early adopters of Revolv Hub.)REVIEWSetup was easy.  You absolutely need an Android or iOS device in order to set up the eeros.  The setup process probably took me 20-25 minutes in total.  I was extremely patient while the eero app on my phone ""found"" each one of my eeros.  It seemed to take 3-5 minutes for the app to find each eero which can feel like an eternity when you're used to...say a bluetooth device connecting in seconds.  All three devices work well.  I'm in a 1500 sq ft condo so 3 eeros is probably overkill, but I have usable wifi coverage in every inch of my home.  I can't speak much to the speed because my internet is only 25 Mbps (megabits for those who care) and eero delivered 25 Mbps in every corner of my home.  None of my devices had trouble connecting to the eeros (two Android tablets, two Android phones, one iOS phone, one Microsoft Surface, one Windows laptop, an XBOX One, a Samsung TV and a Nest (3rd ed.) thermostat.Are these the best wifi ""mesh"" package out there?

"Todd D.",07-Apr-2016,5,"I love it when things ""just work""","Incredible!  My home has been plagued by slow and spotty WiFi since we moved in.  Our area just received fiber and I immediately signed up for gigabit service.  Once installed, we noticed a significant increase in speed (obviously) but the gateway/router placement in the master bedroom closet still resulted in slow speeds and spotty service in many parts of our 3,000 sq. ft. house.  A friend told me about Eero and I started looking into it.  Based on all of the positive reviews and the company's commitment to continuous improvement of their product with regular firmware updates and tech support, I decided to pull the trigger.  I installed 4 units in our home and we are now awash in super-fast WiFi throughout the furthest reaches of our house and into the front and backyard.

Very easy with great instructions & app. The speed and coverage were great.... then trouble. Within a day all the units randomly began to cycle off and on thereby interrupting the wifi signal. It made it impossible to use my work VPN and stream video. I called eero and they confirmed the units were cycling but didn't know why and elevated the trouble report. While waiting for a response, they recommended REbooting and REsetting, Didn't help and they didn't REspond to my further requests. Then I tried REturning and REfund. That worked and now I'm much happier.

"Mr. Truth",04-Apr-2016,5,"eero has changed everything","Fantastic and game changing.  I have a large old brick home that requires internet on three floors.  Here is a list of the wireless routers that I purchased in the last three years and that did not work to provide reliable wireless in our home: (1) Airport Extreme (2) Netgear N900 Wireless Router, (3) Linksys EA9200.  In a failed attempt to make these three different wireless routers work I also added a Netgear range extender and used an Securfi Almond as a wireless range extender.  None of these combinations provided reliable wireless internet throughout our home.  Sometimes everything would work and sometimes some devices would get kicked off the network and could not login without rebooting everything.  The range extenders often did nothing.  Before I purchased eero, I was unplugging and restarting my modem and router at least once a day. Even at its best, I could never reliable get devices to work that required a reliable and strong wireless connection. In particular,  I have 5 Nestcams that would rarely stay connected for a full day. They require a very strong and reliable wireless connection to work.  Also, WiFi calling on my AT&T iPhone does not work unless it has a strong 5ghz wifi connection which I never was able to achieve consistently in my home.  I have approximately 30 different devices connected to our network at any time (5 iPhones, 2 iPads, 2 apples TVs, 1 Roku, 1 iMac, 2 MacBook Air's, 8 Sonos speakers, 5 Nestcams, 1 Peleton bike, 2 printers, 2 backup hard disks etc.) and in order to get all this stuff, I had to hard wire as many of them as possible directly to ethernet because wifi was never reliable enough.eero has changed everything.  It took less than an hour to set up 3 eero units.  Everything worked on it immediately (Note: you have to restart your modem as instructed and unplug an restart any ethernet switches).  We have wifi in every corner of every floor of our house.  Every Nestcam has worked continuously without fail and I have full wifi calling on my iPhone.  The eero app (which is fantastic) lets me check the status of my network from anywhere and has shown 60mbps of download speed, 5mbps of upload speed and all three eero units online since the moment I plugged them in. My family has never been happier.ps If anyone wants any of the routers or extenders the eero system replaced, let me know and I will send them to you for free (picture attached).Update as of June 26, 2016: since the day I set eero up in April, I have never touched it. I have never had to reboot it or restart it. I have never lost internet connectivity for a minute. No other router I have had has worked like this.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19UECRSBV65QZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2MQBEE5JYFIPM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

It delivered on all it's promises of being very easy to set up and working simply and reliably.Our previous system using a fairly high end consumer Netgear cable modem-Wi-Fi router, similar spec-Netgear ranger extender, a power line Ethernet extender and a Time Capsule remained intermittent to several important-but-difficult-to-reach locations.  The eero system has substantially higher data transfer rates and is reliable in all locations around the home --- and we no longer have to manually switch between six networks (2G and 5G for each of base, downstairs, and upstairs).It is expensive, but it works.  It is beautifully packaged:  I would have preferred simpler, environmentally friendly, plain packaging regardless of any cost savings as I just feel bad throwing it away.After my initial install, I contacted tech support about it's compatibility with the power line ethernet extender, and they (the president it appears) wrote back promptly confirming that it would work.  In the end, I have not purchased a 4th unit to place on the extender, as we are actually getting a sufficient signal through our heavy cement floor to the basement that we do not need the additional unit.We are considering putting in an eero system in another home that has similar concrete problems, although with walls instead of floors:  it's that good, despite the cost.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10HRNN4523U5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CYWMD941VJ8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"C. Jones",29-Mar-2016,5,"Really Happy--Great User Experience","For years we struggled with wifi. Even the appliances that were in the same room as the router would have trouble. Roku would periodically lose its connection, the wireless printer would have to be rebooted regularly to reconnect to the network, and the TV in the next room was always hit or miss if you wanted to watch Hulu or Netflix. And forget about using skype in the master bedroom. So I bought the Eero three pack and set up our network last week. It took about 10 minutes to place them throughout my house, and we haven't had an issue since. For me the real test was this morning: I received an email on my iPhone with my new auto insurance cards attached as a PDF. On my old network, my HP ePrint iPhone app would certainly not work: it would never see my printer after a day or two of inactivity. But this morning I was able to send the PDF to my printer without a problem and grab my new cards as I headed out the door for work. Moreover, the easy iphone app means that everyone in my family can manage the network, and I can easily check my network when I'm away from home.I've seen snarky comments that there's nothing really new here with this technology, but what Eero has done really well is thought about user experience--from the moment you open the box it's a simple, graceful and pleasant experience. It's a great home wifi solution and I couldn't be happier with it.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SH6268D78BZF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AN08X9B8NZJR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Michael T",27-Mar-2016,5,"An excellent product that will only get better as it matures","I bought this as a plug-n-play solution to some wifi access issues I was experiencing and it works... brilliantly.  First, some quick background info.We recently moved into a new house.  I was spoiled in our old house as it had structured wiring (Cat 6 outlets in every room) so I was able to use multiple routers setup as access points but hardwired to my main router to spread wifi throughout the house.  So getting signal to every nook and cranny of my house was a non-issue.  Heck - I even felt a little guilty as I felt like I was flooding my cul-de-sac with my own little wifi monopoly.The new house doesn't have structured wiring.  And to make matters worse, my cable modem (in bridge mode) and my wireless router are upstairs in my bonus room over the garage.  The garage comes off the house in an L-Shape so much of the signal has to travel through a brick exterior to the rest of the house.  The house is 4,500 square feet and getting signal to the far corners (with a single router) is challenging.  I first tried using my existing two extra routers (Asus RT-AC66R's) in Repeater mode.  This worked OK... not great.  And the service wasn't steady.  The routers would occasionally drop signal which would wreak havoc on things.  Plus, you can't daisy chain multiple routers together in repeater mode to string signal to the far corners of your property.  And yes, I'm aware of running custom firmware for my routers to possibly achieve this... but I've got 5 kids and a demanding job and this sort of thing is more of a weekend project than a plug-n-play solution.  I also looked at Open-Mesh which is likely a very nice solution but I don't think it's any cheaper than Eero so I quit investigating it as an option.  Anyway - with this setup (using one router in repeater mode) I was getting great signal but the speed was just... ok.  See, every time you make a hop on wifi you take a hit.  So at best I was getting 55mbs which is fine.  Beautiful actually.  But it wasn't reliable as my router acting as the repeater would occasionally drop the signal.My next option was to try Power of Ethernet devices.  I did.  It worked reasonably well but it felt like a sloppy solution because I was taking a HUGE bandwidth hit.  If I'm hardwired to my router I get anywhere from 75mbs to 150mbs download speed and usually around 20-30 mbs upload.  Through the POE devices I was getting 25mbs max.  Even worse was my intranet transfer speeds where I was seeing maybe 1-2mbs.  Transferring a 3GB file was taking FOREVER.  I also tried using my existing two additional ASUS routers on the other end of these POE devices... the wifi signal coming off of this connection was abysmal.  The wired connection was OK but the wireless connection was taking the speed cut mentioned above (75-120mbs down to 25mbs) down another notch.  Best case, I was getting wireless speeds of 10mbs from the routers connected through POE.So I read about Eero and figured - what the heck.  Not the cheapest thing out there but with Amazon's fantastic customer service behind me, if it didn't work, back it goes.  OMG.  I'm floored.  This solution works and works better than I actually thought it would.  Now, in the furthest corners of my house I'm easily getting 50mbs speeds wirelessly.  So yes, with my repeater setup I was getting this as well but the difference here is that it's rock steady and this speed can extend to much further reaches of my house because the Eero system can daisy chain multiple units where I was limited to only using 2 routers with my Asus setup - The main router and ONE setup as a repeater.I had to play around with the placement of the 3 units but I eventually got it setup to where I can honestly get full bars of signal in just about every spot in the house... worst I get is 3 out of 4 bars and the speed is still ridiculously good.  I won't lie.  At first I was disappointed because the second unit I tried to setup didn't work in the location that I wanted it to - I was told by the app that the signal was too weak.  So I had to put it in an unplanned spot (my 3 year old son's room which is fairly centrally located in the house).  Once I had that unit in place I tried to set up the third unit in my office (in the furthest possible corner of the house... and the spot where my signal woes began).  Sigh... no dice.  The signal wasn't strong enough.  But then I realized that the spot I had located the second Eero in my son's room probably wasn't ideal as the signal had to go through more brick to reach my third and final Eero.  So I moved it to the other side of his room so that the signal would be passing through interior walls.  BAM!  It worked and I was able to setup the third Eero in my office.  I then hardwired my computer to this Eero and I'm getting a steady (ROCK steady) speed of 70+mbs.  Intranet transfer speeds (speed between two computers on the same network) are anywhere from 10-16mbs.  Not the crazy good intranet speeds of my wired setup in my old house (60+mbs transfer speeds) but reasonably good considering the data is making two wireless hops.Seriously, all my problems have been solved.  Nothing can replace wired connections but this is the next best thing.  I'm certain that, with enough patience, I could've followed some tutorials online and gotten a decent mesh network setup using my existing 3 routers.  And I'm sure that it would've worked equally as well as the Eero setup.  But like I said above, I've got 5 kids and a demanding job so my goal was to look for something more plug-n-play.  THIS is THE solution.  It honestly exceeded my expectations.So what's the bad news?  Not much to be honest but there are some caveats.  The single biggest issue I have is that I have to use an app on my phone (Android) to manage the network.  It would be nice to be able to use my computer to do this.  Also, if you have a particularly complex network then your options may be limited.  You can do all the basic things that most home network users need (set static IP addresses, setup port forwarding for things like remote desktop connections or VPN access) but some of the more complex features of traditional routers do not yet exist.  While you can change you IP range (subnet) you can only use a few predefined sets.  For instance, my old network was setup using 172.20.1.2 through 172.20.1.254 but this wasn't an option in the predefined IP ranges available for use.  There's also no QOS prioritization or other similar functionality.  If none of this means anything to you then it doesn't matter BUT...Keep this in mind.  This is a product that's managed in the cloud which means that it can evolve through future software updates.  It's NEW and it has a LONG way to go.  It will only get better.  I'm a beancounter, not a network technician so I don't know the technical limitations of what these devices are capable of and what future software can add/solve but I'm guessing most of the current shortcomings will be addressed through future software updates.  Meanwhile this small startup has transformed wifi for the traditional home user and you can call me a big fan.Oh... and one more little thing. These little router boxes have a HUGE WAF (wife acceptance factor) as they are typically replacing units that look similar to the Starship Enterprise with all those ugly antennas coming off of them.  The simple elegance of the Eero allows them to placed nearly anywhere.I plan to update my review as my experience has more legs to it.  I've had the 3 unit system for 3 full days at this point.  I expect my satisfaction will only increase but I'll post updates as I have them.***4/3/16 Update***I've since added a fourth Eero and actually have a 5th on the way.  This is likely overkill but let's just say that getting awesome wifi signal is a bit addictive.  I've also played around a bit with the placement of my Eero units (more on this shortly).  Long story short, it just keeps getting better.  I'm now getting steady speeds of around 90mbs on the computer in my office.  To put that in perspective, with my ethernet over power setup I was getting maybe 25-30mbs at best.  After installing the first 3 Eeros I was seeing 70ish on a steady basis.  After adding a fourth and repositioning my units a bit I'm getting 90+mbs.  To say I'm pleased is likely an understatement.A quick tip on positioning your Eeros units (and something that I hope it built into the app itself at some point).  Do yourself a favor and download a decent Wifi analyzer for one of your tablets or cell phones.  I'm using Wifi Analyzer on an Android tablet and it allows me to name each MAC address of each Eero router (there's actually 2 wireless MAC addresses per Eero - one for 2.4G and one for 5G and these can be found by clicking on each device with the Eero app and then going to details) so that I can easily see the strength of each Eero unit in different points around the house.  This has allowed me to ensure that I'm getting a very strong mesh going and has ultimately improved the speed of my signal in the far corners of my house.  This functionality really needs to be built into the Eero app.Anyway - still loving my Eero units!!***5/13/16 Update***One final follow-up.  This system has completely solved my wifi issues.  Nothing will ever replaced a wired network.  But if you can't have that, this is the next best thing.  It's mostly fire and forget.  Once you've got it setup, you never think about it again and it just works.I'd give 6 stars if they'd let me!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1C7WZR6I4KQAR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3LCDWOTRBX8RM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"Bruce Gerson",27-Mar-2016,2,"Simple setup but it's not a great ""mesh"" wireless network","After careful placement, I found that the eero was no better than the AirPort base stations (current generation AirPort Extremes) they replaced.  Maximum distance between each device was slightly shorter than that required of the AirPorts.  The eeros didn't seem to penetrate the flooring between the floors as well either.All-in-all, these would be a good setup for a novice who has a single floor in a relatively small house and who wants a quick and easy setup.For the price ($500 for three), I would consider another mesh device (if that's what you're looking for) such as Ubiquiti or Meraki and have a pro set them up.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YUP9OGAC0UL9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3RBO7DJDCST97/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

This system made it a snap to cover the whole area with powerful wifi. The signal has been strong and consistent everywhere, and the units themselves are very small and stylishly subdued, with none of the crazy antennae or blinkenlights of other routers. Adding the additional units involved little more than plugging them in and pressing a button on the app.The smartphone app is excellent and very well designed. The at-a-glance information when the app first starts (network status, up/down speeds, number of connected devices) is very concise and useful, and quick access to the names and IP addresses of everything on the network has really simplified setting up other wifi enabled devices around my home.I'd highly recommend the eero to anyone looking for a wifi solution in this price range.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQQD83W2PSJ48/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A37LODT4NRNW49/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Jeff T.",26-Mar-2016,3,"Does its job well, but I still have reservations","We bought the eero 3-pack to replace a Netgear router that could not provide a sufficient signal to several parts of our 5-bedroom home. The setup was very simple, with an iPhone app guiding us step-by-step through placement and configuration.However, I can't say that the setup was truly easy, since the first eero that we configured would not complete the registration process. We were able to switch it out for another of the three units, which worked fine, and the third unit set up fine as an extended. That first device, still, would not complete the configuration. We called the support number for eero and received an immediate answer. We were guided through several troubleshooting steps, but ended up having to have the unit replaced. A replacement was sent quickly and worked great. If it weren't for their phenomenal service, this review would have been much more critical, but I still am frustrated by receiving a defective unit when purchasing such a pricey product.After configuration, we have a great signal throughout our house, and plugging our Xbox directly into the ethernet port on one of the secondary nodes has improved its performance by eliminating one wireless step. Speeds have been great, especially as we watch more TV through the internet on AppleTV and Fire TV devices.Outside of my own personal experience, one of the major hesitations that still concerns me is eero's reliance on connectivity to eero's servers for setup and configuration. With such a new product, I would be devastated to see eero run into financial trouble and end up with hundreds of dollars of paperweights.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVKL6VOS0SWGR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A34BKENJK128WE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"John",26-Mar-2016,5,"Eero Works Great for Covering Your Entire Home","We recently purchased a 5600 sqft home.  Unfortunately, the home was not pre-wired with Ethernet, and a single wifi base station would not cover the entire house.  I was only aware of two alternatives 1.) pay to wire the house with Ethernet and set up several wifi base stations throughout the house or 2.) utilize a single base station with several extenders throughout the house (did this in a previous home and the Internet was slow, and the extenders had to be reset regularly).I saw an advertisement for Eero, and I decided to try instead of the 2 options above.  I used the rule of thumb of 1 Eero per 1000 sqft, so I purchased 6 of them.  The setup was fast and easy.  Also, I am able to have high speed internet in every room.  The Eero system is pricey, but it was significantly cheaper than wiring the house with Ethernet cables.  I am very pleased with the purchase.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RERDPU4ZCDJ6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A298MY211B8KP9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Chris",26-Mar-2016,5,"The best home wifi router you can buy at the moment","I have had this system for about three weeks nows covering a 3000 square foot house and 800 square foot basement for a house built in 1942. The plaster and mesh construction pretty much makes every room a Faraday cage. I bought a three pack and an additional unit for a room over the garage which I almost don't need. With this setup I get 5 bars through the house and even in my front and back yard. I have slow, crummy U-Verse but this system pipes it through the house faster than anything else I've used and that include a top of the line D-Link system with multiple repeaters and wired access points. Setting up Eero is super simple if you already have a good internet connection into your home. Bridging newer U-Verse modems is somewhat tricky but that's not the fault of Eero. I wish this setup was a bit less expensive but I can't fault its performance, nothing at any price point performs this well with such simple configuration in the consumer space. I expect others will catch up in the next 6 months or so with competing offering but if you need something today I can't recommend anything else. My only reservation would be what some other views have noted. Eero is a startup and if something where to happen to them these would turn into paper weights pretty quickly.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1O9VY7B8I4U2G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A19M2YF5FT7L1F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

In the past, I have spent days to months trying to tweek the ideal WiFi home setup with mixed results. Before getting the Eero system, the only way I had to get a reliable enough connection was through an Asus router, a second one acting as an Access Point (AP or bridge mode) and then two professional-grade Cisco APs. This was always plagued by devices remaining connected to an AP at the other end of the house instead of automatically connecting to the nearest one with a strong signal.The Eero fixed all my problems. For my home, I bought the 3-pack plus one additional one that connects via an ethernet connection to the room over the garage. Despite combining wired and wireless eeros, the setup was incredibly simple and flawless. I just had to plug one eero in at a time starting with the one attached to the comcast incoming modem and wait for it to show up on the Eero app on my Android phone. On day one out of the box, 4-5 bars everywhere in the house with 67Mbs down and 10 up; by day 3 with the system analyzing its own usage and balancing itself, and ever since, I have enjoyed >100Mbps down and up to 12 up...identical to the speedtests I'm getting on the hard-wired computers at home.With 34 devices all actively connected in my home, this system is amazing.

"Barinr",24-Mar-2016,5,"Very, very pleased.","I am very computer literate but know far less about wifi except that it either works or doesn't. I ordered the Eero system because the fairly expensive router and repeaters I had been using kept dropping the wifi connection. It would, all too often, require relogging in, speeds were slow and in certain areas, particularly the laptop in my office and the wireless printers, would completely loose the connection. I bit the bullet and bought the Eero system. Installation was a snap. I remember spending hours on the phone talking to technical support in India to get the previous system set up. Nothing against India but I would rather not have to spend any time with technical support to setup any product. Download an app for IOS or Andriod (No Windows), mine would only download to my phone, not sure about iPads. At any rate just follow the simple steps to set it up. I installed the first to Eeros without a hitch. On my third Eero, the app couldn't find it so I moved it slightly closer the base unit. It was then picked up quickly and the system was ready to go. I did have to setup the wireless printer to see the network. I didn't change the network name or password to avoid having to setup the smart tvs, iPads and phones again. Plus the password was a good one. The Eero works wonderfully. I bought it at full price and received no compensation, but that would have been nice. My review would have been the same. One last thing, Eero checks your internet speed daily. You can see the speed by opening the app. I found my speeds were far lower than the cable company's claim or the speeds my other app reports which defaults to the cable company's server. In other words, you now have a really good way to verify your internet speeds.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1V300P9K9QL4T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A15NB6PGR33G14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"James",22-Mar-2016,3,"10 minutes later, deadspots are gone!","******Update: September 9, 2016:  I'm slowly falling out of love with the Eero.  One of my 3 (very expensive) routers slowly died -- becoming increasingly flaky, then causing the whole network to go down until I finally realized it was the flaky router to blame.  Once I removed that one, luckily I was still able to get adequate (not great, adequate) coverage for my whole house.  In the last several weeks, I have noticed devices just start getting kicked off the WiFi network.  If I disable and re-enable WiFi, they reconnect with no trouble.  This would be annoying but manageable if Eero provided any look under the dashboard at all to see if maybe there's a DHCP problem or something, but in the quest for simplicity, Eero have locked the user out of the configuration and log details you might see in any other consumer networking product.  I'm sad to say, but I'm in the market for a new WiFi solution and looking forward to seeing if the Netgear Orbi system is finally the answer to my prayers.******Update: May 16, 2016:  NOTE: This router is not compatible with the Arris Surfboard 6183.  I loved my Eero so much that I upgraded my internet speed, which meant the ISP had to provide me with a new modem (you guessed it, Arris SB6183), as a result, I can no longer run Netflix from my FireTV.  Very sad!  Eero engineering team are aware of the problem and are working on it, but it's been several months now.The Eero is very powerful and ridiculously simple to setup.  I used this to replace an Airport Express Basestation and two Airport Expresses in a 3000 sq. ft. split-level (4 levels connected by half-flights of stairs) house.  It took me literally 10 minutes to set it up.  As it turned out, I only needed 2 of the 3 included Eeros.  Every corner of every level of my house gets a strong, fast internet connection. I know it's pricey, but this was well worth the  extra cash for saving frustration in setup and daily use.I noticed they just announced a 2-pack literally the day after I ordered my 3 pack.  I don't regret the purchase, but I'm guessing a lot of people can save some money unless they have a really enormous house.

Before eero I was using a high-speed AC router/Wi-Fi plus two additional access points to get coverage in my whole house. But when I walked from one end of the house to the other while using streaming services or Skype I would frequently drop the connection for a few seconds when my phone switched from one access point to another. Sometimes the phones would get hold on to a connection to a distant AP (instead of switching to a closer AP with a stronger signal), and end up using the cellular data instead of my Wi-Fi. I've been using the eero three-pack for over a month now, and have not experienced a single dropped connection throughout the entire house.

"Steve Tennison",16-Mar-2016,5,"It's Worth It Because It Works","For 10 years I've lived in a 1,600 sqft house built in the 1930's and for 10 years I've suffered with abysmal wifi performance.  It seems they built houses like Faraday cages back in the 1930's so that a wireless access point on one side of the house would be unreachable by a wireless device at the other side of the house and the devices in the middle wouldn't fare much better.  I've probably tried a dozen wireless access points and extenders over the years and finally spent well over $200 on a fancy dual-band WAP with a high-gain directional antenna and still kept losing connections in parts of the house.  As if to rub salt into my wounds, the signal strengths from my neighbors' networks were often much stronger than signal strength of my own network.  How rude!Being desperate, I decided to give the eero a try.  If it turned out as bad as every other option I've tried, I'd have Amazon's quick and convenient return policy to rely upon.  But, I'm happy to report that I didn't need to exercise that option.The eero was, by far, the simplest WAP I've ever set up. (Not that any WAP is all that tricky.)  The iPhone app worked like a charm and I ran into no problems setting up my 3 eero devices that hitting ""Retry"" couldn't solve.  (Word of advice: Don't stand in front of your 2nd or 3rd eero devices when they're testing themselves for acceptable range.)  Although none of my eero devices are within line-of-sight of each other, I still get connection speeds almost as fast as if I was plugged into my router.  My three eero devices broadcast a total of 6 networks (3 at 2.4GHz and 3 at 5.0GHz) and those 6 networks are all in the top 10 strongest networks I can see.  The device I sit closest to is always on top of the list.  Fantastic!

The second and third one had trouble being found but after timing out on the third attempt to find the devices each time it gives you an option to add it by serial number and both were added no problem.  My wife and I both work from home primarily and we have seen a major increase in speed.  Also for the first time we have a full wifi signal is the back part of our house and into our sunroom.

"Tog",16-Mar-2016,4,"Perfect as long as you have a house with nothing that blocks radio signals","It took me four days to get the installation working properly, but, now, it is fantastic. The hand-off as you move with your devices from room to room is completely smooth, as opposed all other systems I've tried over the years, including multiple Airports.The installation problems would have disappeared if eero were exposing to the user what is going on. Specifically, my bedroom system was working some of the time and not others whether I wired it direct via Ethernet or used the mesh radio system that's built in. Unfortunately, as far as I can tell, two critical pieces of information are currently hidden: First, whether the router is communicating via Ethernet or mesh radio. In my case, the switch failed to recognize the router until I restarted the switch so that, even though I was plugged into Ethernet, the router wasn't actually using it. Had I known that, I would have played with the connection for a bit instead of abandoning Ethernet, assuming some kind of bug in the eero software that was making it not work all the time.  Assuming that eero had a problem with Ethernet, I spent the next three days trying to get the mesh radio communication to work.Second, you can't seem to see what the signal strength levels are on the radio signals among routers, so you have to just keep guessing at where to place intermediate receivers. Since the signal was strong enough to work sometimes and not others, this turned into a major problem, with my moving the router locations six times, with the signal still remaining intermittent. Please note the actual signal problem is not the fault of the router. I know there's a signal problem between the main part of our house and the master bedroom that was added on later, probably due to foil-lined insulation in the previously-external wall. The problem was I couldn't read the signal strength. (You can read the signal being put out by each router to your devices, but not the separate signals sent among the routers themselves.)With luck, eero will address this lack of information with updates to the apps. On the other hand, eero has obviously learned much from Apple, certainly much of the good stuff like the packaging and hero's super-easy as-long-as-everything-works installation process. I can only hope they haven't learned the bad stuff Apple is doing, led by withholding vital information from users in order to generate the illusion of simplicity. I lost four days screwing around with this system because of an absence of information. Had I known that the Ethernet connection had failed, I would have recycled the equipment immediately and not spent 3 days trying to use radio in a house that's not suitable for radio.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRX4NCNPMXJKF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A9P0IBS598RNT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

I bought an eero to attempt to replace my Netgear Nighthawk 7000 and 2 Netgear range extenders in my ca. 4000 sq. ft. 2 story house.  The Nighthawk worked well, but there were still areas in the house that had marginal wi-fi, and the existence of 3 networks was a continuing challenge to less tech-savvy users in the household :)The eero system (3 pack) was a breeze to set up and immediately gave full and complete coverage (with a single SSID) all over the house.  I did have some throughput issues; the throughput was lower in some areas than the Nighthawk (but always higher than the extenders), but I finally solved that by repositioning on of the eeros boxes.  Now I get great performance connecting to my ~180Mbps Comcast connection and near 100% signal strength everywhere in the house.  eero tech support was quite helpful in solving these issues (though the turnaround time from them was a bit slow).The only improvements I would make at this point (2 weeks after purchase) would be some more tools to help in optimizing performance (signal strength meters viewable in the apps, better network mapping representations) and also the ability to stealth all ports.  I have been seeing more portscans and network attacks than with the Nighthawk, as the Nighthawk stealths all ports, and the eero only stealths a few.Highly recommend this system.Update after several months:  This product is fantastic.  Literally set it and forget it connectivity.  I have had NO issues with eero, just solid, fast wifi all over my house.  An excellent product that lives up to its marketing slogans.Update 2: I decided to buy another single eero direct from eero.  FedEx lost the package and was a complete and utter pain to deal with.  After about 7 days, I contacted eero and told them what had happened.  Eero support was absolutely wonderful, took my info and said they'd get back to me.  4 hours later, I got a notice that my replacement eero had been shipped.  Even though the original order had 5 day shipping, they shipped the replacement overnight.  This time, FedEx actually delivered it!  10 minutes after receiving it, the new eero was up and running.  Great support is critical in a company like this, and eero delivered an A+ experience.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3AO2NONFVHV0J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2RYI0YNOEB1LM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

Everything works well and setup was as simple as advertised. Performance is great. I like the simple setup (especially multiple-eero setup) and the small-footprint design. I only hold back the 5th start because the price/packaging feels a little high/awkward (the 3-pack seems reasonably priced per-unit, the 1-pack seems a little high-cost per-unit).

It was awful.Setup for the eeros were a cinch.  Since we've gotten them in the house our internet speed and stability has improved profoundly, we only have one SSID, and nobody's complaining anymore.  I had a slight problem with my wireless HP printer not connecting properly to the new network -- I contacted customer service about this.

"Marv in Balto",15-Mar-2016,5,"thinking that they sounded like exactly what I'd always been looking for","I've tried nearly every type of wi-fi extender over the years, both in my former residence and my new one, and while they were okay, they never gave me the performance that I was looking for.  Even the dual band routers/extenders with 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz bands always left some part of my house  with less-than-adequate connectivity and performance. Wireline extenders are OK, but even they lack some of the crispness of signal that we all have come to expect for our online experience with our wireless devices.  After reading the review of Eero in the Wall Street Journal a few weeks ago, I immediately ordered the three-pack, thinking that they sounded like exactly what I'd always been looking for. They were delivered promptly, only took about 20 minutes to install, and I couldn't possibly be more pleased with the results.  We are about to put an addition on our house, and when it's done, I will buy at least two more Eero's to cover that space as well.  I am particularly appreciative of the fact that these are going to be automatically upgraded by the company as new software improvements are developed.  On a scale of one to ten, these are definitely an eleven.  They do exactly what they are advertised to do, are very user-friendly to set up, and are unquestionably worth the price.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37MQ8DL6JPGXR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A19BNKKZ1VEQ30/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Jason S.",13-Mar-2016,1,"Don't purchase, does not work as advertised. Devices have not been Quality tested, and they overheat to dangerous levels!","Horrible product.  I purchased this for the very purpose that the creators envisioned it for, setting it up for someone else so there would be far fewer issues.  This product simply does not work as it is advertised to.  I purchased this for my parents to replace a Ubiquiti UniFi system that I had set up for them that was working great with the gigabit Time Warner Cable service, but required maintenance from time to time if the power went out for an extended amount of time.  This forced me to look for a solution that was self healing or a simple troubleshooting application that my parents could handle without having to use a terminal connection to the router to reset.I was willing to pay nearly any price for a seamless solution that could cover a large home from one side to the other with speeds that could deliver Video-on-demand to simultaneous televisions, handle about 4 - 5 Macs, a couple printers, as well as handle the variety of Nest Thermostats, and Nest Protects installed around the home.  This seemed like a task that should be attainable from a $500 solution, then I came across the eero and I thought that with the resoundingly good reviews on Amazon this product would be a surefire way to solve the problem.  How wrong I was.  This system is complete garbage, I have a good feeling that the positive reviews are being stuffed by the eero team, as their customer service line is unanswered, not what I would expect from a product that is going for a premium price.I suppose that they are handling quite the volume of angry telephone calls in regards to people in situations like I was in while at the same time creating Amazon accounts and reviewing their own product.  I returned the system to Amazon (they are great about taking back horribly designed products) but could not pin down the issue I was having until more real reviews started appearing with similar issues that I was experiencing. The common thread between all of the negative (real) reviews was the brand of modem being used (Arris / Motorola brands). This is quite the surprise since it is also the most commonly used modem brand in the country.I have a very high speed connection and these devices cannot handle the switching needed for more than perhaps 10 wireless devices without overheating.  When connecting the devices that the average home has connected over wifi, it simply crashed these APs and the eeros were extremely hot to the touch.  For example these devices would randomly stop responding and shut down requiring one to pull the power to the device and the modem to get a reset.  I expected that a system that went for such a high price would be tested and reliable, especially for the most common modems used in the country, however this set of devices is worse than many routers that you can get for less than $50.  Perhaps it could work for someone seeking to only connect a couple computers to the network, but if you add a Roku or Apple TV to the network, the bandwidth requirements of transferring the videos it will crash the system I am assuming due to the processor of the eero reaching nearly 250 degrees fahrenheit.  Purchase at your own peril, if you dare to try it be sure to stress test it right away to make sure you will be able to return them in the return window.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PJQPP7XB83IU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1JCGPPRL9XKVB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

By then I was looking around for other options and Luma was offering their product for half the price (but had to wait another 3 to 6 months to receive). I was going to cancel my eero order but checked on it and it had shipped - company must be psychic or something. So I kept the eeros.

I was dubious about this product when I first heard about it. I read five or six reviews and saw their tests and still thought....yeah, I will be wasting money.  The review that changed my mind was someone that had Comcast, and lived in an older building with the type of walls I do. Reviewer mentioned how this improved the service and does not blame Xfinity for the problems as much as he used to. That intrigued me enough to spend a decent amount of money.Got the box and had a small issue with setup. While setting up the first unit by the router, there was a failure message after I named the location for it. Stated it could not locate it any more. I tried a few times to figure out how to reset it, before I realized that it was back online and working well.  Not blaming the system for this - minor issue that I easily resolved. Had the whole setup done in 20 mins...and most people would have it done a lot quicker than that.Here is the con - and the reason for 4 stars. I did email Tech support.  I mentioned in the email that the eero speed test on the computer site was a bad link. (I could test it on my phone, but I really wanted to test it on my laptop in different parts of the apartment.  I also asked if there is a detriment of putting the units too close together.  Some parts of eero stated they should be 40 feet away, but when one of mine wasn't being located that far away, it recommended putting it closer and said 30 feet away. So, I was curious on since I was only using two of the three units, what would be the negatives of having them closer together and using three.  I think it was three or four days later I got a reply that my network speeds are great and they recommend not changing the setup.  That is good info to have, but it didn't answer the two issues.  1) speed test link on their site is not working  2) what is the negative of putting them closer together.  This may seem trivial  and if I could give 4.5 stars, I would...but if I email with questions, I kinda want the answers - especially if the app and site gave two different distances, and the site provides a link that does not work.Back to positive stuff:  My internet since moving to this apartment and switching to the demon spawn known as Comcast has been horrible. I couldn't watch Netflix at certain times of the day, and even had buffering issues on Youtube. Sometimes basic loading of sites were annoyingly long.  Set up this unit, and have had no buffering issues at all. I am getting the download speeds for the actual internet package I bought.  Very easy set up.  For someone that lives online, and gets most of their entertainment from online, this is a blessing. Even my PS4 has no trouble staying online (with gameplay or even just downloading updates).The price seems a bit high, but for the situation I am in, and for how much I am online, I am 100% fine with the price of this product.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VAAOOILQCBB8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AJ3BFV2H7EZ2I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

I have been using now for 2 weeks and have not had any problems with streaming movies on acorn.tv. Before I installed the eero home WiFi system I was having problems with the movies stopping and reloading several times during an hour and a half movie. I have not had one movie stopped since I installed eero. IT really gives me complete WiFi coverage to my home.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27X4UQLABTY0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2D1IPKVJ8RCWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"Todd",09-Mar-2016,5,"Finally - WiFi Throughout the House","I rarely review a product, but after seeing the results of the eero, I feel like I need to do just that. For years I have used a variety of routers and extenders (Apple, Linksys, Nighthawk, etc.) in an attempt to get a reasonable and consistent level of WiFi throughout my house (a large, two story house), but that has never happened - the signal would go in and out, and it was all but impossible to get a signal in my kitchen. With the eero 3 pack, I solved all of that and have strong, consistent WiFi signal throughout my house, including that troublesome kitchen. Installation was easy, and my family is thrilled to have WiFi everywhere.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NIBHINXCWNO4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3JX2UA8GX13UX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"Carlos A. Echevarria",09-Mar-2016,1,"#hellnoeero","I was forced to give this 1 star in order to leave a review. Personally I would give it no-stars if it was possible. I had high hopes for this product, what can I say it's marketing strategy was great. I've also been looking to upgrade my old wireless network. So let's break down my experience so far;got the product on Friday and it was very easy to setup. I ran into some issue with speed so I then switched it to bridge-mode. Still had the same results. Now the first thing I noticed was than my laptop felt slower since I was opening and closing files form my file-server. So I decided to check and see what speed I was actually connected to the eero. My late 2011 MBPro reported that I was connected to a solid 300Mbps. This threw me off for a bit, since on my older network I was always connected to 450Mbps. So then I'm like hmmmmm this is weird, I have both eero's hardwired. One on each end of the house on separate floors. Then I'm like well I'm about 4-5 feet away from the nearest eero. Shouldn't my speed be quicker, so I power off wireless and power it back on again. Just in case I was connected to the eero downstairs and I was getting a weaker signal, right makes sense. So now I have a solid connection, thinking I'm on the closest eero and that my speeds would be faster. #Hellnoeero, I'm still locked in at 300Mbps. So I decided to check my other devices, my ATV4, Roku 4, Sonos are all moving and responding slower than they were before. So I'm like okay let me power cycle my devices, just incase something else is going on. Keep in mind that all of my devices have static addressed via my Server.app, but I'm like hey it's worth a shot. Same thing nothing has changed expect that the devices are moving/responding slower than better. So art this point I decide to call support. I get the typical recording that their call volume is higher than expected and that call will be picked up in ""35 minutes"". So I decide to ride it out, an hour and 45 minutes later I get to someone. Now I'm finally happy to speak to someone, I'm hoping that they can help me. I describe the issue and they ask to put me hold while they research it. Sure no worries I would like a hard concrete answer. So they person comes back and I'm told that it appears that the devices are connecting to N speeds. So then I let them know that I was getting these speeds with my old wireless setup. That I was using 6th Gen AEBS, which then I was told that maybe Apple is doing something different when the decides connect to their AEBS. So at this point I'm like what?!, are you saying that ""there is some Apple Magic happening here?"". To which I get the answer of yes, it appears so. Now four days later, today actually I get this email from support:""We support both 802.11n which theoretical max is 300 mbps and 802.11 ac which theoretical max is much higher. Perhaps the device you are seeing speeds of 300 mbps is using the 802.11n standard.""So they don't appear to state what's the theoretical max for AC, hmmmmmm.So I email them on Saturday since I got an email to let me know that firmware was updated. So I launch the App and I see that I'm still running 1.0.4. The email was sent by Nick the CEO, so I reply back to him. Asking him what exactly has happened, since I noticed that the firmware was the same. I get a reply notifying me that I got the message by mistake or late, since I already had the most current firmware. Signed by the CEO of Eero, so I take this opportunity to ask him more question and vent my disappointment and frustration. I mentioned that I understand that's a new product, that they are overwhelmed with calls and emails but they should really communicate with customers better to help reduce the stress and frustrations. I get no reply, so I head over to twitter and post my issues as well (within the 150 character limit of course). No replies either. So we went with the weekend of using the product. My wife notices the speed difference and she mentioned wasn't this supposed to make it faster? All of a sudden one of my NestCam constantly is dropping out. The Nestcam is directly above the the room where the main eero is connected. Not to mentioned that this is the NestCam that is in the nursery and of course it disconnects  when we need to use to check on our kid. Now my wife is not happy at all, so I send out another email about this issue. Come Monday, I get home from work and the wireless network is completely worthless. Nothing is working as expected. I remove the eero's form the App so that they reset to factory defaults. I re-connet my 3 year old, now extremely reliable AEBS. I used the same cables, add the MAC address to Server.app and get my same iP's that the hero's were using. Guess what, everything went back to ""normal"" speeds were better, devices responded faster. Our laptops backed up faster via wireless and the NestCam has not dropped not even once since Monday evening and it Wednesday evening today. During the weekend with the eero's, the NestCam disconnected every 3-4 hours. So I get a reply from eero support today as well.""If your Nestcam's are dropping offline I would power cycle them so they get a new DHCP lease. If this does not resolve the issue you may want to contact Nest as we have not had any other reports of the eero devices losing connectivity to Nestcam's.""About 96 hours with my AEBS and my network has not had one hiccup yet. However with the eeros during the same time period, my experience was horrible. How do I measure success, simple. No devices are dropping of the network, and the main factor. My wife notices the differences and let me know that things were faster.All of this has lead me to create the hashtag #hellnoeero. Please think twice about the product and I would call sales/support first. If you can get to them that is and get a clear expectation from them on what the product can do and what it can not do. Bottom line, don't set false expectations about your product.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GFEYLX3VR0KI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1I4MWPD1JULKD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

If you like to hide your SSID like I do for added security, you can't with the eero.  When I contacted them ask about it, they said they don't offer that option.  And didn't indicate they would or planned to do so in the future.  Make sure you beef up your passwords.2.  It looks like the system can go anywhere and you are covered.  But during setup, the instructions are the units shouldn't be more 40 ft apart and they work best if they are in line of sight.  I couldn't do that and it seems to be working.  But if you have an older house with plaster walls and metal, you might have a problem.Overall I am happy with performance to date.

"Milo",08-Mar-2016,5,"Nailed it.","I've been waiting for a week to see how things panned out.  TLDR; Yes, this is an excellent product.  I took 5 speed check measurements at various points around my small house in Seattle.  After installation, I did the same. My spreadsheet tells me that I went from 1.19 Mbps to 66.68 Mbps in my basement, 5.98 Mbps to 42.23 Mbps in the bedroom, 42.95 Mbps to 80.00 Mbps in the dining room, 7.16 Mbps to 95.71 Mbps (!) in the living room, 7.35 Mbps to 45.15 Mbps in my office, 34.54 Mbps to 51.54 Mbps in my other half's office.  Setup was very easy; I did need to reset my modem but that was Comcast's fault, not Eero's. The Android app does everything that I need it to.  I'm completely delighted; this was a rare instance when a piece of new tech absolutely delivered what it promised.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1D9S3SFEV026/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1GOE0IHDVICD2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"Tech guy",08-Mar-2016,5,"Eero Totally Worked for Me!!","Purchased 4 of these to cover 4 k sq ft home and guest house. The house has lots of concrete walls which made getting signal everywhere challenging. Prior to Eero I used a router, access point and two range extenders. All together counting, 2.4G and 5G, I had 5 different networks on the property. In the past I have also used repeaters. None of these solutions were satisfactory. Besides the multiple networks there were still dead zones, network drop outs, and most annoying the need to keep changing the network name for the laptop/phone depending where you were on the property. Installation of this product was flawless. I had all 4 routers up an running in less than 30 minutes. The connection is strong now throughout the property. Speed is slower for the most distant boxes but still 2-3X what I was getting from my prior setup and very acceptable at 20+Meg. Handoff between the boxes is mostly perfect but on rare occasions I need to turn wifi off on the client device and back on. I have not had any problems with boxes disconnecting or the red light coming on. Yes it is an expensive solution but when I consider the frustration I have had dealing with the coverage problem, the cost of buying the hottest next generation router, hoping that would fix the problem, the inconvenience of continually changing the network name as moved about, and the occasional cost of hiring a network expert to try to solve the problem (unsuccessfully) I consider it one of my better investments.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30X8QSW3LIDRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3R5RTGOEYRXHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

We need to support private and guest nets and we need to support both 2.4 and 5.0 devices. The Guest segment must be isolated from the private side as well as each other. To accomplish this, we previously had a complex router configuration and FOUR WAPs running. The biggest problem (aside from the tedious maintenance and delicate config) was the varying signal strength (and speed/reliability) in different parts pf the office. Sure, Cisco and others will happily sell us $3000+ in gizmos to handle this.  I was VERY skeptical about a $499 ""homeowner"" product doing the job. But, it was up and running (in Bridge mode) in < 60 minutes. Everything works as expected and hoped. We left the old stuff running for more than a week as a safety rollback but never needed it. Back to my one word; Amazing. One small black mark irritation... the two mobile apps are not created equal - IOS allows more capabilities - such as check-boxing Bridge Mode - not cool in this marketplace.

Yes my entire apartment now gets solid wifi signal everywhere. But...* Be prepared to use your old router because the software on the Eero is way too immature right now and use the Eero in bridge mode. UPnP doesn't work properly which means most media and gaming consoles don't work properly.* Firmware updates happen sporadically on your devices and it doesn't always happen overnight.* When things go wrong... you don't have any mechanism to troubleshoot. Just un-plug, re-plug and hope for the best.* While your device has strong signal to nearest unit, your actual connection speed will be much lower (I average 30mbps in the worst spots) so you may still not be able to stream video in all areas of your home.* Android support right now is basically not there.But the biggest problem is the simplest for them to fix which is why I give them 1 star: They don't communicate.* They don't blog.* They don't acknowledge their issues publicly.* They don't post change-logs of firmware.* They don't properly triage support tickets or give you an ETA on a response. Your best bet is to call them which is annoying.* They are incredibly slow to respond to email and unless you call or tweet at them do they pay attention.

"Colleen D.  Egan",05-Mar-2016,5,"Great solution for large home with multiple floors and dead zones","We have a 3 story home with a basement and had horrible speeds and connectivity with AT&T so we switched to Comcast Internet  (chicago), but had the same issues. We tried really researched and expensive extenders, but nothing worked...especially in our basement. We researched EERO and decided to give it a try. First of all the packaging is beautiful and well designed, secondly the android app offered ridiculously simple step by step instructions and offered suggestions and lastly...it worked!The initial unit was a breeze to set up. The second unit was one floor below and directly underneath the main unit, so 15 ft away max. The unit was easily found but the signal wasn't great. The directions suggest placing every unit within 40ft. of each other, unobstructed, so they can see each other...this is close to impossible in any home...but be patient!! I moved unit #2 even further away instead of closer, just to test it and after two cycles it was perfect. I then placed unit #3 in the concrete dead zone basement and let it cycle. On try #1 it alerted me that the signal was low, but as before, I cycled it again with same results. I decided to unplug and try again. This time the app couldn't find it but asked for the serial number. Once entered it was found and had a strong signal.While this may do understand lengthy, it was actually perfect in less than 20 minutes and fixed a long time issue. Our download speeds tripled. We are airbnb hosts as well, so we usually have multiple devices being used at one time. The EERO app showed 7 devices in use today and everyone was happy with speeds.The units have even extended our outdoor reach which will be great in the Summer.The app is super informative, easy to use, runs speed test on demand, has access to support, ability to add extra units and each can be identified.It's like Internet success for dummies!

"Damion Michaels",05-Mar-2016,1,"Extremely disappointed - wasted time and money","I have a 3200 sq ft two-story house. I pre-ordered the three pack and two single eero units. After waiting for nearly a year for the 5 devices to ship, I got nervous about coverage and ordered three more from Amazon. Installation was a breeze and I was able to place these units in optimum open spaces. However, since installing the eero network, and (trying) to use it for a week, I have had nothing but grief. The connection is never, ever consistent. And seems dramatically slower than the four Airport Extremes I replaced. I am extremely tech savvy and have tried everything to include the dramatic step of having the cable company to come out and make I had the strongest signal coming out of the cable modem. I did try to email and call eero tech support, but surprise!!!! they communicate as well as they did during the pre-order phase - which is to say non-existent. Anecdotally, t seems that if you have a small house and can install the eeros with direct line of sight, you seem to have some success. I went for excessive coverage and still the performance is less than the system I had in place. And as far as video steaming goes? Please don't even try. It seems that the signal travels in waves from these units and regularly drops the network. Netflix has gone from flawless to aggravatingly unusable. For a wireless device so expensive, you would think that the wireless in these devices are so powerful that software issues would be tolerable. Not so. So the eeros are going back and the old, much more reliable Airport Extremes are going back into service. I have an extra 5 pack of eeros if anyone wants a great deal - as I can't return the pre-orders. Not ready for prime time. Might consider 2nd or 3rd generation if the reviews are honestly good.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UY5PPLU2FX09/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1WQUQVVRLFXIH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"Cocca",05-Mar-2016,1,"Would not recommend for serious internet usage...for now.","SO far........ eh.For very general web usage (Web Browsing, streaming music, etc.) this system works great. My speeds have increased about 3X my previous setup and the general installation was a breeze.I've run into issues though with gaming on PS4 and Video Conferencing on my PC. So for most of the time the gaming and conferencing work fine, how ever, at random intervals my connection just drops. To the point on PC gaming where I get kicked back to the main menu and in video conferencing I have to go in and reconnect to the meeting. The strange thing is that it happens at random intervals. Some gaming session for example, I may get one drop in an hour, in other sessions I'll get about 4-5 in an hour. Because of this I simply cannot recommend this right now for anything outside of general web browsing. I have hope that they'll have some software updates that we alleviate this problem, and if so, it can't come soon enough! I would have been more lenient with the stars but so far trying to contact support has not worked, I got one reply back, I then gave them my setup, and then they've gone dark, it's been 2 days.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16I984I2WUF4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2H4FGFK6HASHT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

The only thing I do wish eero would do is provide an application for this as a business-grade solution, as what currently exists is not robust enough to be used outside a simple home setup.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LETCBT2B5WD9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1T0E8SIVDUJVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"PHX Mac",04-Mar-2016,5,"Very Impressed. MUCH better than an AirPort Extreme.","Wow...what a difference.  I bit the bullet and bought the 3 pack. I still think it is quite expensive. BUT, it really does work much better than the Apple AirPort Extreme I bought almost 2 years ago.  Over the past 2 years my wifi would buffer and freeze. At first I thought it was the cable modem, but in order to solve it I had to unplug the AirPort Extreme (which is an ""a/c"" device so it should be fast) and restart it.  That would be the only way to solve the problem.  Apple (who usually is really good) said that ""at times"" you need to restart the AirPort Extreme by unplugging it and restarting it.  You shouldn't have to do that for a $200 device.  Since we installed the eeros, we saw a noticeable increase in speed and stability.  Our home has 14 internet connected devices and it's amazing how fast things are.  I feel like we have been missing out over the past 2 years.  I would highly recommend these devices and it was a breeze to set up.  Sorry Apple.....you loose on this one.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RW3VN6VWIW9FH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A28FMP2YG5M2FX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"Kelvin A Choi",04-Mar-2016,2,"Not ready for prime time...firmware needs more time in the oven!","Disappointing so far! It is easy to setup (certainly easier than the vast majority of WDS systems of repeaters). Major points for the Eero app design in getting set up. I was able to set up 3 Eeros in a mesh network, 2 of them wired to ethernet as well (I use FiOS as my provider, with the FiOS router WiFi disabled) as a single unit unwired. This was very easy. However, my Wink Hub and Chamberlain MyQ garage door opener had major problems connecting until I redid the setup. I am NOT factoring these problems into my review since it is unlikely the Eero was at fault here. But this did necessitate multiple hours of getting the Wink Hub and garage door openers online and talking to each other, so I mention it more for other users who may struggle a bit. I did get these working eventually (with exceptions, see below), but be aware that you should budget extra time if you have picky smart home products.My discontent is actually aimed at the reliability of these units. They do seem to provide very good coverage (they are being used in a single-story, 2700 sq. ft. home, mostly open plan) and decent speed. However, my devices constantly lose connection to them (iPhone 6 Plus, iPad Air 2, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air - sorry, don't have any Windows machines w/ wifi, only ethernet, so can't say anything about that). When this happens, I notice that the Eero's LED is blinking white, meaning that it is ""starting up and connecting to the internet"". It has happened 3x in the course of writing this review! Make that 4 times.This was going to replace a system made up of 2x Apple Airport Express's, that have been completely bulletproof and were also easy to setup (but not as elegant as the Eero app for sure!). In fact, the ease of use of the Eero app makes the unreliability of the Eero network twice as frustrating. They should have spent as much time and attention making these stay up reliably as they spent in designing the app.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RI2C52N8H6LA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A338M5V3U29O93/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

When you receive the product, it will tell you that it works best if the additional units are within 40 feet of the router connected unit. It also says that it works best if it can see the other unit - If the units can see one another, then I'm guessing if the devices attempting to access the first one could see it, you wouldn't be looking to extend the signal to start with.  That said, my router is installed in my front office and would require considerable wiring work to even think about moving it. I had the second unit within 15 feet of the first one and it would not recognize and sycn with the first unit. I couldn't position them so they could see each other due to the design of the house. Basically, my current wi-fi extenders work solidly, albeit that they do have different names that the devices must switch to.

"jenny whyte oliver",03-Mar-2016,5,"FINALLY WiFi that works!","I have been fighting internet issues for quite a few years. During those years I have purchased newer and better routers/modems and added two different (dLink and Linksys) extenders, all of which still had trouble in my house (my house, is very tight and doesn't allow the wireless internet to get all over my house). Because of all of those problems I was forced to add another router in my house, which is called a roommate router, because you are only allowed one router in each house, go figure. Anyway, it costs an additional $50 a month. Good news, it has helped. Anyway, as a last resort, I have purchased a new internet booster system called Eero. Very easy to install. So far, so good. I have a system of three, one of which is connected to the router, and two others placed around the house. By far, these extenders have worked further from the router than any other kind of router I have purchased before!!!! I am going to use everything for a month, or so, then turn off my roommate router to see how everything works. Maybe I will be able to eliminate the roommate router and still have internet throughout my house. I will keep you posted. btw the reason I think this system works better is because it connects directly into your router which then boosts the signal throughout the house.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OZE3XD51D1KH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2OWIP6P7A54O4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

The product packaging looks like something from Apple (highest praise), and the setup is a breeze.For years I have been suffering with WiFi in my home and home office. My 100Mbps connection worked within a small radius of my powerful Asus router, but dwindled to 5-10 Mbps, if that, in my home office about 20 paces from the router. I played with several brands/kinds of routers and network extenders (will have those for sale in eBay soon), 2G and 5G, with terrible results. Even in a small apartment, my connectivity was lousy.I don't quite understand how eero does it, but I now have 80Mbps in my home office, even at 6PM which is when everyone else connects in my apartment building and my internet used to slow down to a crawl. I used to blame my cable provider, but now realize it was WiFi noise infecting all channels. I can also connect my AirPlay music devices with zero dropouts.Yes, $500 for three eero modules is a LOT of money. And yes, I expect this technology will become prevalent, with prices dropping a lot in the near future and maybe congestion growing in their ""channels"" or whatever (did I mention I don't understand...?).

"Dan Moore",03-Mar-2016,5,"Finally! After years I have wi-fi! - with update a few weeks later","I have an unusual situation that I had to solve. I'm trying to add wifi to a house that is 9000 square feet. The house is not heated and cooled at 9k sq. feet, it's built around a 4500 square foot masonry area so the house is a big hollow square. All sides of the house have one interior/exterior wall that is masonry with rebar reinforcement. This mean signal is a bear to get across the house. I had an awesome IT guy on staff and I've had him out here installing, tweaking, testing, etc. wifi over the years. No matter what I did I had decent to terrible signal. We've pulled hard lines across the house to have multiple wired access points, we've switched to the same enterprise system we used at work, we've done it all. The end result is my signal was crappy. Plugged into the router, I get 18-23 Mbps (max provided by AT&T). As I get into living areas, it drops as low as 1-2 Mbps. It varies by day, and with that level of signal drop, it sometimes just dies all together. Just recently I finally ripped out the existing access points we had and installed new Apple airport extremes. The signal was pretty much unusable meaning the frustrating enterprise access points were actually doing the best job possible.Since my IT guy doesn't work for me anymore, I can't have him come out and fix my issues any longer so I asked him if he had any ideas of what I could do. He shot me a link to Eero. Hmm, never heard of it. Amazon had it so with trust in Amazon's return policy I thought I'd give it a try. I pulled out the Airport and plugged in the Eero unit #1. (after installing the Eero app). In about 10 minutes I had it running (power issue on my end). Once it popped up live, I checked to see if it was working correctly and the internet popped. Very quick. I went into the room where I had 1-2 Mbps with the airport extreme and I had about 14 Mbps! This was a room where I couldn't pull cable so my thought was I could use the Eero to get some kind of decent signal. I had 64% of my total available speed before I even installed the second Eero. I quickly installed the second Eero in this room which basically meant plugging it in and selecting next a couple of times on the app. Once it came alive I rechecked. 23 Mbps! Absolutely full speed that was rock solid. Finally I went to the other side of the house to install another wired Eero to give signal over there. Another minute to get things installed and boom! 23 Mbps. They are installing fiber on our road and I frankly didn't care. My wifi was so bad I'd never be able to use fiber's speed. Now I'll be chasing the installers around asking them when I can get on the list! We still get some variance in speed as 23 Mbps is our rock solid top speed on our service but now that variance is with AT&T, not my wifi.I use OpenDNS to block content on our internet. Eero has a simple screen to enter custom DNS. 30 seconds and I had it working. No double NAT, no extra access points. Nothing. Dead simple.I used a wireless scanner to check the signal in the entire house. I've only covered two sides of the four sided square. According to the scanner, I've got plenty of signal in the whole house now. No problem. However I have more areas to cover besides the house.Because I didn't finish covering my property (I have an outbuilding where we work that needs it's own internet) I'm here ordering another pack of 3 to finish blanketing our property with rock solid wifi. That's $1000 worth of wifi, which is stupid. But if you've tried to work with crap wifi for years, you'd gladly pay for something that actually works. Eero actually works. It's also already automatically upgraded it's own software and emailed me to let me know it's done rather than the funky firmware upgrades I had to do on my old access points. It may all blow up later and I'll regret this. I know some other companies are coming to market with a cheaper alternative. But at this point they aren't to market yet so I'm sticking with Eero. It's actually a pleasure to use the internet again and I'm seven years into dealing with bad internet. Hopefully never again.Update 3-11-16After having the units installed about four days, I came home to find them dead. Two of the units had a red light rather than the normal white and one had a white light. I really fumbled trying to get them back online as the app was having trouble connecting, the internet was barely able to be used, etc. Eventually I deleted the entire network from the app but the devices didn't reset but my app did so I couldn't log in again. I finally contacted support and about a day later received a response with some things to try and that that person was escalating my case to another person who also contacted me shortly thereafter. The helpful tip, which I'd requested in my initial request was how to do a factory reset on the devices. It's a paperclip and hold the button down (tiny hole in the back of the unit) for 15 seconds. Once I reset all the units, I did the quick and easy reinstall which took about 10 minutes this time. Everything came back up and has been rock solid since. No idea what caused the issue but support worked, the units reset, and I've ordered another pack of three units which set up beautifully in my out building. Now if my internet is slow, I got to the AT&T router and reset it and it comes back to full speed. Wireless is NOT my problem anymore. This has solved so many problems I was having I cannot begin to explain how wonderful it is.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14HEBI8WACXFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A15Y38AGIHTOXU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

Over the years I have tried every new configuration and I could never get the right coverage or speeds. Extenders never offered the right speeds or coverage area, so I wired multiple routers but with that one would drop off or other complicated issues. A week prior to getting the Eero I purchased an Amazon Fire Stick. It was located less than 20 feet from my D-Link AC3200 and the picture would just stutter. I forgot to return the Fire Stick, so when the Eero arrived I tried it, and the picture was absolutely perfect. Installation was very easy and now my entire property is fully covered with most areas seeing full wired speeds. I would recommend providing the system 24 hours to update the software and pinpoint the devices to optimize coverage. I have over 75 devices on my network including many home automation devices. I have seen zero drops and speeds have been consistently high. When I programmed the network name and password, everything connected without any need to reprogram the devices or find the network.

I hate to admit it, but I even know some people that work at Eero.. Thats why I was willing to put my Apple wireless router which was not cheap by any means. The promise of faster internet and being a techy.. I was excited and looking forward to faster home internet.Yesterday, the unit arrived and in the evening, I tried to set this thing up..  Spend over an hour attempting to first, download the app, and I kept getting errors on both my iPhones..  after it was finally downloaded and the app and unit connected, I got stuck in the registration.I gave up and re connected my Airport Extreme network.Day 2, another attempt, same issues trying to register unit. When I finally managed to register the box, it worked but the performance was not better than my airport extreme network.Most notable issue was reach of wireless network. I purchased one Eero because I have one Apple Airport unit with coverage on the entire top floorI tested this thing trying to stream a movie in the kitchen (25 feet from unit in living room) and not only did it not work, but the Speedtest results were as bad as they could get (I could not even pull up an email page.I don't know if I have a bad unit but its definitely going back tomorrow.. not sure what those great reviews are for?  Cant imagine they had Apple Airports and or wonder if they are even real.  One Eero should be strong enough to cover one floor in the home, and if its not, then its far to expensive given competitors products / pricing.Oh, and holding the laptop next to Eero did result in one excellent speediest result.

Previously I used to mess about in a complex IP-based set-up site, which looks like it was created back when DOS reigned supreme. I have 18 devices in my home network, from printers, streaming videos to WiFi thermostats and ""smart"" sprinkler controllers. With the Eero iPhone app I had all three devices set up in less than 30 mins.I ran SpeedTest before and after install, and the results seems too good to be true (see screenshot). With the old system, even with it's range extenders, I was getting at best 29 gps download, but now I'm getting around  89 gbs. The upload speed remains at about 6gbs.I'd certainly recommend this product.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5Q93JMLAIYFH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A46DLWHCHQCDA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Keith L. Klein MD",29-Feb-2016,5,"Outstanding product and service.","I am revising my original review.  I was contacted by Eero who offered to work with me to try and set up the network.  I had limited time and did not want to reorder and again have to return the Eero so they very graciously offered to send me a unit to test for free and arranged for a tech support call on a Sunday morning, which was most convenient for me.  They called as promised, actually ten minutes early and we went through the complete set up.  The Eero worked perfectly and I then installed two more of the routers seamlessly.  I find this company to be incredibly responsive, knowledgeable, and most patient.  Furthermore, unlike any other company I have dealt with, they trusted me and sent me a three unit version of Eero without my giving them my credit card or any other financial information.  I cannot recommend this product or this company too highly.  And I will gladly pay them for the Eero system, and in fact will order another two routers.  It is important for the reader of this review to know that I am paying them and will not accept it for free, so that my review has more credibility than other product reviews where it is provided for free in return for a good review.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7UOGUCCELIFR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AOR2IZ9B1TFYC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"D. Pane",29-Feb-2016,3,"Not as good as they'd like you to believe.","Don't believe the hype and reviews. It does great for just extending wifi - but even then, it completely disabled my TWC Roku app and a few other Roku apps from streaming any content. There is no web interface to log-in through the gateway so typing in the router's IP address will get you nowhere - and what passes for a gateway is an overly simplistic app, which provides for next to no way to actually fix any problem. A lack of parental controls, blocking for filtering, and shut off switch for SSID broadcasting doesn't help either. The units themselves get extremely warm over long use. It's overnight updates will have the tendency to knock out known-good setups and have you start over the next day. Its definitely a 1.0 and for the price it should be starred that way. I'll give it 3 because it does do well at extending wifi - but for $600, it's not worth it. I need my equipment to just work, not create more problems. Clearly the engineers forgot to do any field testing. I will be returning this soon.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KZQTOZ3RY8GQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AYTWYRA7KADAV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"Kal",29-Feb-2016,2,"Seemingly amazing miracle product - Doesnt live up to the hype.","I was stoked when I heard about this mesh wifi. I have a 3 story townhouse and I was hoping this would be a good solution for me instead of using APs throughout the house.Everything was fine after I installed. Super easy to setup and get going. I used the same SSID as my previous router so all of my devices automatically detected the new network. Wifi was super fast after I 1st installed it. I went around the house on my iPad and I was getting 200mb down when I was getting 120 previously. I was amazed at how these units optimized my speeds. My glee turned quickly into frustration when I started to realize how many limitations this system has for unknown reasons.1. Netflix will not connect on my XBOX One, PS4 or Apple TV. These are my primary ways to watch Netflix. This is the main reason I am returning it. This is quite funny because on their site Netflix is named in their product description. I have seen other reviews with issues with netflix as well. How could this be an oversight on there part?2. I use an FTP regularly for my profession to get assets to and from clients. FTP transfers were half as fast on this as compared to my previous router somehow. Also I get random disconnects on the FTP a few mins into any downloads. Dealbreaker.3. My Logi Circle camera will not work on this wifi. Not sure why.4. My PS4 just will not download anything. It says im not connected to the internet although I am on the wifi.Only reason I gave it two stars is because of the ease of setup and the packaging.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VQ0Z8NQGIM1T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AEWNKP71DOTCZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"orange-man",28-Feb-2016,5,"If you have pain, it will fix you pain","I did same day Sunday delivery because I couldn't wait. This is my first day review, I will amend if anything changes. Setup was a breeze just like everyone says. I placed my 3 units and it let me know that my 3rd unit needed a better position.I had an expensive Asus 68U that I purchased six months ago. It was OK, but the speeds never matched the speeds directly coming out of the modem. There was always a hesitation and dropouts. I had to restart it every day without fail.The eero works like a champ. The house is bathed in strong signal and top top top (did I say top?) speeds. It is so fast and so smooth, I am delighted.The only place where the Asus beat the eero is outside the house. I'm at 65-70 Mbps in the house and out in the garage inside the car and out in the driveway, I get around 17-10 Mbps. I'll take it.If you are a new router purchaser, this costs a ton of money. Maybe try something cheaper and you might get lucky. But if you are like me on your 6th router still in pain, still chasing something easy and reliable you can't go wrong with the eero, it will ease your pain. For me the pain wasn't coverage, it was reliable consistent service and I can already see it is much better than my Asus.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EALND0VA3Z20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1B32O79GQDZ1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"IB",27-Feb-2016,5,"Does what it says it does! Can't wait for improvements over time.","Huh. It actually worked! I purchased this in a last-ditch attempt to avoid rewiring my home at great expense with new cat-6 cables. It's expensive, but I can conclusively say it's completely worth it. Across a large, 3-story home with 3 Eeros, i'm seeing consistent 200-300mbps speeds. Not as fast as gig ethernet, but you know what, it's good enough. It took about 24 hours to get up to that speed -- at first, i was seeing as little as 20-30mbps in far corners of the house, but something changed overnight.It's not perfect. I wish I had much more advanced controls; I *definitely* wish I didn't have to use a mobile phone app / there was a web interface; I still have to keep an old router around to drive PPPoE since that's not supported; only two ethernet ports are limiting, and mean I have to use hubs in two locations. But basically, Eero does exactly what it says it does and makes mesh wireless work and work well.It's expensive as all getup, but if they release a future rev that can do 3x3 or otherwise get closer to gigabit speeds, I'll be there.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2C26E30T2SV0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3TZO1SR0U8AGF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
