"L. D. Weller",15-Apr-2017,5,"Very happy with purchase","Finally my family is no longer complaining about WiFi access speeds.  Compared to Small Office/Home Office routers which I've purchased over the years this product was easy to set up and configure and works reliably. Very happy and have recommended it to co-workers and friends who have family embers frustrated with lack of signal in some parts of the house.  I was a little concerned about maintaining enough bandwidth for VOIP but have had no problems so far.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RR14Q259GDYT2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AYDSCPPWPXF9S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"Baradanikto",15-Apr-2017,5,"Replacement for Three TP-Link range extenders","I bought the three unit mesh network to replace three TP-Link POE range extenders.  The range extenders would occasionally drop signals and force me to use a different SSID when I needed a better signal (depending upon the location).  The eero units worked out of the box and provided much better and stronger coverage than the range extenders.  Setup was easy using my Android smartphone.  The only problem I had was with my  Canon wireless printer.  The eero installation sets up a new network with a different IP address scheme.  After installation, I could no longer print because the printer was not ""discovered"".  I had to reset the printer settings and re-install the drivers after pulling the plugs on two eero units.  I needed to pull the plugs because the eero units use the same SSID for each unit.  The printer install would not let me install initially because of the duplicate SSIDs.  Temporarily removing two eero units allowed me to connect the printer to a single unit and finish the install.  Once the printer install was done, I re-plugged the two units and all is well.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2EMNXRZICW3O8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A7KCAN9VNVOBX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"RoadRage",14-Apr-2017,4,"Your mileage may vary","I struggle w/ 4 or 5 stars. I am a engineer and my network maybe was a bit different then the intended audience and I want to be fair if this is at all the cause for my challenges. That being said, if you are looking for a simple to use wifi mesh that will cover a large square footage home, this is a great product and dead simple to install. My only complaint is after initial install the app stated that ""Everything Looks Good"" although I was unable to pass traffic from any wireless connected device. It was not until I went into ""Help-->My Internet is slow-->Run Health Check"" that there was a sign of an issue. I just found this very misleading and as a technical person I did know howto logically troubleshoot but would my friend or family member or would this be a call to the guy who recommends it, me ? The other issue was an undocumented feature that suddenly appeared after a software update that now my wireless devices can not converse with my wired devices, this presents an issue because my wired device is my desktop/media server and now none of my devices can do app hand off in spotify to my desktop.  Another EXCELLENT win for this solution is support, I spoke with a girl who was extremely knowledgeable and courteous and would say this is the best consumer network device support in the industry right now.  Please keep in mind, if you have a very simple cable modem and wireless setup, you may have no issues but I have a cable modem, router, switch, wired VoIP, wired desktops, and now Eero for wifi and there are some challenges.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28HK5MKP0EFZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/ALM31S9O8EWW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"wsconn1",09-Apr-2017,4,"Set up was very easy. The only problem I had was that after ...","These appear to have resolved a problem of spotty wifi around my house.  Set up was very easy.  The only problem I had was that after getting these set up, they auto-updated the software and the app got frozen -- although the eeros themselves were working.  I finally deleted the app and reinstalled it and everything has been good since then.  I am surprised that I do get an occasional message when trying to use my iPad and my Apple TV, both in the same room as an eero, telling me that the signal is too weak.  There is a clear line of sight between all three devices and the Apple TV is close to the eero but a bit lower.  I'll experiment a bit with placement and assume this will be resolved.  Regardless, I would recommend these because of the design, ease of set up and blanket coverage elsewhere in my house.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R367T67OMQQIWF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AH6CRBKET7IFC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

I read online that everyone says they are very warm when on so I decided not to risk future failures and have decided to try the Linksys Velop system.

I cannot say the same for the NETGEAR Nighthawk AC1900 Dual Band Wi-Fi Gigabit Router (R7000) with Open Source Support. Compatible with Amazon Echo/Alexa that I purchased in January 2015 and its companion, the NETGEAR Nighthawk AC1900 Desktop WiFi Range Extender (EX7000-100NAS) purchased in June 2015. At the time, I thought I was out of my mind spending $400 on the eero Home WiFi System (it would've been $500 at the time, but Amazon offered a promo of $100 off), especially considering the amount of money I had already spent on the Netgear Nighthawk equipment. While the Netgear equipment provided fast throughput, I clearly decided 6 mos after purchasing the router that I needed an extender. Also, by 2016 I was experiencing dropouts all the time to the point that I routinely had to cycle the router nearly every day. I could not for the life of me figure out what was going on w/the Netgear router. I was so frustrated that I simply had to try the eero Home WiFi System. To date, I've had no dropouts; no need to cycle power - the eero simply works and is frustration free. I have one in second floor my home office, one in my upstairs bedroom, and the third in a cabinet (supposedly a no-no re: reception) that house my gaming systems, DVR, etc. There are currently 23 connected devices including 2 desktops, 3 laptops, 2 tablets, 3 cell phones, 4 Sonos speakers, 3 streaming devices, 3 Arlo cameras, 1 Ring doorbell camera (which prompted the purchase of the Netgear Extender), multiple Hue lightbulbs, etc. etc. When needed and in use, everything that is on my network works and works well. I never experience buffering issues when streaming music or TV. Web pages load quickly and multiplayer gaming is lag free. I also have a strong signal in my front and back yard! (I'm using this with Comcast Blast Plus!I also like that they are low profile and simply elegant compared to the beastly size and unattractive look of my old Netgear equipment (currently housed in a drawer until I figure out what to do with them). The only draw back I can think of is that there is only one ethernet port. However, that problem is easily solved through the purchase of an ethernet switching device such as the one I purchased for roughly $10: NETGEAR 5-Port Fast Ethernet 10/100Mbps Switch (FS205).  Oh - and I initially had an issue in which I had a problem getting eero to work with my employer's VPN and customer support was quick, friendly and solved the problem. That was the one and only problem I've had with these. All in all, If you're looking for a hassle free solution to router/WiFi issues and you don't mind that you're not going to be able to tweak various settings like QOS, then the eero system is the way to go. Frankly, I don't miss looking at or tweaking the various settings on Netgear's software - I really don't have a need to with the eero since it works as expected. Which is to say that the eero Home Wifi System exceeded my expectations and was definitely worth the expense in order to achieve hassle free WiFi throughout my home (including the yard, attic and basement). Highly, highly recommended.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RIE9270DQORZL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2PO4VFBUEUOI5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"L. Liroff",01-Apr-2017,5,"Very Satisfied.  Easy Set Up.  Works well with Apple Express","I had an existing WiFi with an Apple Time Capsule supplemented by Apple Express's throughout my 2100 square foot, two story house.  The system wasn't working.  Typically, upstairs I was getting speeds in the neighborhood of 3 to 5 mbps.  Not satisfactory to run Airplay well.  So I bought an Eero 3 pack.  Set up was so easy.  Really.  I mean really.  I had trouble getting my Apple Express connected to the Eero system so I could continue to run Airplay.  I got great help from Eero's call center from Nick who talked me through it.  Now my system works seamlessly.  My Apple Express are connected to my Eero Wifi and Apple Airplay works perfectly every time.  Plus I was able to, with Nick's help, connect my Apple Time Capsule to my system so it keeps backing up my system.  The speeds now upstairs consistently run from 25 mbps to 45 mbps.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTYQH5CVQ8XNW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A10IQXU3R3JROE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Kevin Haggard",31-Mar-2017,3,"eero Mesh Wifi Not Magic - Don't Buy If Existing Wifi Setup Works","I purchased these on the hype to replace a set of 3 Apple Airport Express and 1 Apple Airport Extreme that blanketed my house. I had a few problems with moving to room to room on WiFi with the Apple set-up so was willing to try the mesh wifi world. All 4 of my eero's are connected to a switch at home which is connected to the router - which is the same setup I used with the Apple Airports. The couple of issues I have had are:- eero units randomly flashing red lights and not being available - this could be for a few seconds or longer- not playing well with multiple WeMo devices and switches throughout the house- I have had multiple occasions where the wired Internet speeds are 45 Mbps and the eero speeds are less than 10 Mbps with no activity in the houseOn the plus side - I think the iOS software is nicely done.TL;DR - I bought the hype on these units - but don't think the premium is justified. Stick with your old wifi setup if it works. This will not magically make everything better i.e. unicorns riding on rainbows will not deliver stable and fast Internet speeds to every corner of your house.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDATHHYN2HMNG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AU35JOCRE0NGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"Steven D. Arnold",31-Mar-2017,5,"Best-of-breed wifi solution. Excellent!","I've tried many different wifi base stations over time. Most of them were somewhere between decent and unusable. Even high-quality vendors, like Apple's Airport, still kicked my devices and my family's off the network or didn't give good coverage throughout the house (which has four floors), thus resulting in poor or no performance in many cases. I have young children who sometimes watch movies on an iPad, so bad connectivity translates directly to an unpleasant day for me. I have to have a solution that works.One idea I had was to put a different wifi router in each part of the house, hardwired via ethernet. The downside with this is if you connect to the one on the top floor with your phone, and then you walk downstairs, your connectivity is bad. So an interesting idea, but not really practical. And don't even start me on extenders. In my experience, they're all terrible, assuming they work at all, which is often not the case.eevo really solves this problem and does a great job. I got the package of three base stations. I have my own internal network and don't want to connect the eevo directly to the Internet, so I set it up in bridged mode and made it serve a range of DHCP IP addresses. (Note: these are advanced settings, but it's nice to know it's possible to do this.) In my case, all three base stations were connected to house ethernet, which probably helps, but this is not technically necessary, according to eevo. (I did not test this, because I'm happy with my current configuration, and I'm sure at any rate that ethernet will be faster..)The three base stations merged seamlessly into a single wifi network, available throughout the house. The network offers very strong signal (all bars) everywhere. It's the same network, so there's no need to connect to a different network in a different part of the house. The speed is excellent, very comparable to the best wifi routers I've used in the past. And neither I, nor my wife and kids, ever get kicked off the network. It's extremely stable.It did take me a while to figure out I really wanted bridged networking. I just needed eevo to give me wifi DHCP access to my own network, nothing fancy beyond that. Also, the eevo documentation insists that you must plug your primary eevo directly into the service provider's modem, bypassing any firewalls etc, but this is not in fact necessary -- or I should say it might be necessary if your firewall is set up in an overly restrictive manner, but it was not a problem for me. (It might well also have been a problem if bridged networking had not been a sufficient solution for me.) I guess the point here is the docs are less than clear about this.Overall, eevo provides exceptional service in signal, in speed, and in stability, far better for a whole-house solution than anything else I've ever tried -- and I've tried many, many different things over the years. It's a clear winner and if your needs and problems match those I described, I strongly recommend that you give eevo a try.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OZ1PWMU91ULK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1VCZU26BQI13/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

My first attempts failed on a successful mesh network using AT&T Uverse DSL, I followed the setup process and googled and tried what others suggested. Eero just did not work as advertised on AT&T.Fast forward to 6 months later after being frustrated with AT&T speeds I switched over to Wave Broadband and got the 250 Mbps down and 10 Mbps package. Initially I took there generic cable modem/wifi router. What a disappointment, I had better speeds than with AT&T however I was not getting what I paid for. So I decide to purchase my own cable modem (Arris SB6190 Surfboard) and the eero system again. After a few kinks getting everything setup and the eero updates they system has been working flawlessly. I now have complete mesh wifi coverage at full speeds and more in my entire house. I know the eero system is very pricey however it really works and to me it was worth every penny.Bottom line is eero really works and it works well on Wave Broadband.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R348OBEHJASGGZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3JY9TO4XRTC9Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

While they started out slower than the linksys, they were still fast enough for everything we needed. The problem comes that within a week or two the speed drops off to almost nothing. I had my macbook pro literally 2 feet from one of the hardwired base stations. I was getting 2mbps. I restarted the base station (which requires you to unplug/plug it back in). After it came back up, I was getting 180mbps again. Not having to restart the eeros was the only reason I bought them (i.e. rock solid wifi). Their support was fairly good, but we never could get them to work 100%. So, I returned them. At this point, I'm back to using 4 airport extremes (all hardwired) around my house.

Mangan",27-Mar-2017,5,"Delivers as advertised & and responsive customer service!","My long time network configuration - an Apple Time Capsule with Apple Airport Expresses as network extenders finally had to be ""retired"" because network performance was becoming inconsistent. It served me well for years; however, I could never get a solid wifi signal throughout my home, nor the performance throughput I was paying for with Comcast.Got tired of my wife complaining about as the signal degradation the past year. Watch the Eero video on their web site.....it is spot on. I was doing everything the guy in the video was doing. I purchased Eero's products, because I didn't want to deal with a non-consumer friendly, poorly designed, and less than stellar performance networking solution. I did look at competing mesh networking products, but chose Eero for the favorable customer experience.Set-up was as easy as everyone has written about. Just plug the devices in as instructed, and everything was recognized by their iOS app. Took a few minutes on my devices were all online. I kept my same network name as my old one and the same network password, so all my devices were recognized.Only task I had to do was update the firmware. The firmware update done via their iOS app and the network worked perfectly after upgrade. The only extra thing I did was assign a unique name to every device on my network. I did not care if I didn't have all the configuration parameters like I did with my Apple set-up, because I never used the overly technical settings to begin with.I now have 17 unique devices on the network with no reported problems. This includes one Nest thermostat, three Nest smoke alarms, one Apple time machine network drive, two iPads, two iPhones, one Apple TV, one Amazon Fire stick, one Apple iMac, one Apple MacBook Pro, and a five others for good measure. No lags, no offline conditions, etc. It appears to just work.Observations:- Easy to install and set-up.- Eero constantly improving their software and features. Very easy to see how committed they are to making this a best in class product.- iOS app is straight forward. No bloated app design. They keep it simple and clean. No way to get lost in it.- App allows you to turn off the device indicator light.- Covers my two-story home with consistent high throughput wifi coverage.- Responsive customer service. When one of my devices failed after 48 hrs. I called Eero and got a live person who spoke English...they shipped a replacement device immediately. All I had to do was return the defective device in the package with pre-paid shipping label. Easy.- Easy online Help information. Again, information is easy to find/search for, well composed, and offers easy to follow instructions.- Delivers a consistent and available connection across my 2200 foot two story home. Check out the awesome performance I am getting in the picture I posted.Misc.- One satellite device failed after 48 hrs, but Eero replaced it immediately (thank you Eero).- When checking the wifi performance via the iOS app, it is not clear how the network speed results are determined. It would be nice know which device it is testing the network throughput from. When I test with Speedtest.net, I get a totally different network performance number. I don't know why. Maybe another user can enlighten me. I did notice when I check the network speed on multiple devices with the Eero app....they all activate. Interesting, no issue on that, just my curiosity why?- I wish the devices were smaller in footprint like the Apple Airport Express.No showstoppers, a positive customer experience, and my wife is happy with her husband again.Thank you Eero, keep up the good work!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1E4AZST9CPNCP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1T5BC1E4NESOY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Steven",24-Mar-2017,5,"Best WiFi I have ever owned!","My house was built in 1969.  It is a double split-level and has steel beams in between the floors.  It has been near impossible to get acceptable WiFi in my house since we moved here in 2003.  I have spent hundreds, maybe thousands of dollars in attempts to get WiFi to cover most most of my house.  Multiple zones and APs.  Powered antennas.  WiFi boosters.  Nothing worked well.  I have been using ethernet over power adapters up until now because of this.  I had attempted to use mesh routers in the past, but they were enterprise class and too expensive or hard to manage.  So eero has been a breath of fresh air.  They have been exactly as they were described.  I love the fact that there is no manual.  Just download the app and go.  I plugged the first into my gigabit router, worked as expected.  The next one I was expecting issues.  I have had so many problem going from the office to the living room.  Number 2, no issue.  Wow!  Ok, number 3 in the upstairs solarium.  No issue.  I could not believe it.  There are no more dead spaces in my house.  No more putting my phone outside the kitchen to play streaming music because I couldn't get coverage.  Before eero I had also recently moved to gigabit ethernet for my internet service and was so disappointed that I was getting a fraction of the speed to my devices.  It seemed like a complete waste.  Now I am getting optimal speeds for the wireless technology and actually seeing the difference in having gigabit.  I've already recommended to a friend and he bought there right then and there based on my testimony alone.  I can easily say, these are the best WiFi routers I have ever owned and I no longer worry about if my WiFi is working.  Thanks eero!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FWAWYKVH4HM5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3CWRR1SL9ZNFP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

However if you want to locate them in a cabinet you will need to take measures to avoid overheating.  I put rubber feet on the units to increase ground clearance and drilled some discreet ventilation holes in the cabinet.

"Bill",18-Mar-2017,5,"Great purchase, Highly recommend","This is simply an exceptional product.  In summary, it was relatively easy to set up and provides strong, fast coverage across my home.  Prior to installing, download the app and set your phone to cellular with bluetooth on (turn off wifi on your phone).  Follow directions setting up the base device (I believe they are exactly the same but I will refer to the 1st device as the base).  You might want to conduct a software update at this time but I'm not sure it really matters.  Let the app lead you thru the set up of your satellite devices which should be line of sight and 40 feet or so away.  I did run into problems with the second phase as I was experiencing a bluetooth glitch.  I eventually called tech support which was fantastic!  They quickly answered and solved the issue.  The completion of the set up was a breeze from that point on.  I was told that this wasn't a common issue but its nice to know that the support line was this good.  I was working off of an Apple time capsule prior to installing the Eero device and it lost coverage and speed across the my house.  The difference is simply striking!  I could average 5 - 20 Mbs download depending upon the room I was in except for the extreme points in the house where is was a crap shot as to signal.  Now my coverage is 25 - 40 Mbs in the far reaches of my home.  Note: the Eero app seems to test your potential speed not the actual speed (it seems to regularly give 60Mbs as metric).  So I was using another speed test.

"milodaman",15-Mar-2017,1,"Product issues and dubious company policies"," I hate to have to write this review as I really wanted these Eero's to work. However, as it turns out, my old apple airports never had the issues I experienced until I switched over to Eero. Once I switched back to the old airports, all the following issues went away.Frequent DropsAs seen in the attached video, you'll notice that the throughput goes up and down every 30-45 seconds, which is significant enough that it causes streaming music to pause frequently. Of course streaming video was a non-starter. I spent over a month trying to debug this with Eero support with no luck. Note that this issue happens no matter the distance to the access point.ConnectivityMost of my devices connect fine. However, I have a couple of devices that seem to have connectivity problems on a regular bases. One of my MacBook Pro's required me to hard code an IP in order to maintain a connection. Same issue was found with an iPad as well. Note that this issue happens no matter the distance to the access point.CompanyIt's also important to note that I tried to work with the company to resolve these issues for a couple of months. I started the process with Eero Support within the first month, creating videos and providing long detailed explanations regarding the behaviors. They logged into my devices remotely to monitor the behavior and also sent me a custom firmware.  However, now that it seems like they won't be able to fix the issues, I asked for a refund. However, eero refused because they said it was over a month since I purchased the product. I explained that this hardly seemed fair given I, in good faith, worked with their support organization to resolve their product issues, conversations which started BEFORE the month mark. I would recommend folks thinking about purchasing an eero make sure you quickly confirm the performance of the product and return the product right away if any issues are all are found instead of working with Support given this policy.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37EQ6K8IQ6LD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3OMP7FQM82DCP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"G. Thompson",12-Mar-2017,5,"Excellent signal strength; Idiot-Proof Installation","We had an older WiFi with an extender that gave us constant headaches -- we often had to unplug the units several times a day and signal strength was uneven throughout our large house. After doing research on the eero vs. Google's unit, we decided on the eero not only because of the good reviews (in Amazon and in the technical press) but also because Google requires you to make the unit part of the ever-creeping Google ecosystem that watches everything you do in searches, emails, and the like, and adds it to the profile it keeps for you in order to sell ads more targeted to how they have you categorized. I would rather have my WiFi system just do its work without whispering about me to Google in the background!The system is dead easy to set up -- literally, we just plugged and played, following the directions in the app. It worked right out of the box. Since installing eero, we have had flawless service - no interruptions and signal strength throughout the house is high.The design of the units is sleek and unobtrusive. Although we didn't need to ask for help, apparently the support offered is excellent.This works as well as any modern internet product we have put into service in recent years.

I have each of them connected to the backbone using Netgear PLP1200 Powerline adapters, so the communication between units is very fast.  I get full upload/download speed via my ISP and extremely fast communication between computers inside my home.Unfortunately, I did run into a limitation.  I like to use a non-standard network range inside my house.  This way, when I travel with my laptop, the hotel will not assign me an IP address from that range, so the personal firewall will not think it is on my home network.  The eero configuration will only let me choose addresses from RFC 1918 (10.0.0.0, 172.16.0.0 or 192.168.0.0).  I prefer to use 6.6.6.0 /24 since I figure no hotel would ever assign me an IP from that range.  I have done this for years using various routers, but the DHCP settings of the eero just will not allow it.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MU3YQ8L3UW65/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A26SNCU5287VJT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

Over the years we've experimented with different consumer-grade access points (Linksys, Asus, TP-Link, etc) and always had the same issue.  If you sat close to the AP you had excellent service.  As soon as you got a good 20-30 feet from the unit it all went downhill.  We're in a highly congested building in NYC so there's a ton of channel contention.  We considered business-class mesh hardware/software from all of the major manufacturers; Ubiquity, Ruckus, etc.  Unfortunately the pricing and learning curve was going to be substantially more than we were willing to invest.  After much debate we decided to buy six eero units and place them throughout the office in bridge mode.  We couldn't be happier!!!  Setup was unbelievably easy and the system is very reliable.  We regularly have anywhere between 50 to 70 devices (combination of Nest cameras, tablets, phones, and laptops) connected to the system and performance/throughput is solid.We get it, these aren't necessarily meant for business use but quite honestly, if you're a small business and don't want to hire an engineer to install and maintain expensive hardware this may work for you.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3L4HM81UP430I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AG8P99C7CUQD5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"D. Day",20-Feb-2017,1,"Bad for remote access.","It's not working at all for remote database access.  Nothing needed to be configured on the previous Apple AirPort Extreme to allow remote access.  However with Eero, we had to set up port forwarding.  After the port forwarding set up, it got messier from there.  We were only able to access the database from out-of-home network or cell data.  When we are in the Eero network, we'll receive a server not reachable error message.  Eero tech support said they will consider this feature.  I am not sure what feature they are talking about.It's a great device if you are only using it for web, email, and other stuff.  But I'd avoid it if you need any remote access to your home network.  Not working.  ""NAT loopback"" or ""hairpin NAT"" should be supported like any other routers!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4M0JGM80KZZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A359VNXZGIO341/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

Unfortunately, it doesn't work well with my WiFi Camera. Every two weeks, the device looses it's connection to my network and has to be reset and reconfigured.  Big pain! And I waited too long to return it, because the Eero folks were trying to help figure it out, though not very effectively. Now I've got these two devices, and just want to get rid of them so I can stop worrying about my camera.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2AL4TYQPWSS7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/ALSVRJQE2THZT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"Computer Geek",20-Feb-2017,5,"Thanks eero for a great product!","Absolutely excellent technology.  We were using a high-end router and 3 extenders in an effort to obtain consistent speeds.  The install is easy and the app is very well-designed.  We have as many as 25 connected devices including computers, tablets, TVs, Amazon Echos (5 of them!), Ring doorbells & cameras, Hue lights, WEMO switches etc. and the network is rock solid.  There is no more yelling from our son's area in the far end of the house.  Note we have a house with older and probably odd construction so even line-of-sight from the old router wasn't working too well.  As I write this we are getting 109 down Mbps / 12 up.  The most I've noticed is 115 down.  No more daily router reboots from the cable modem in fact I haven't rebooted them at all since installation.  Netflix performance is very much improved and rarely goes out.  My guess is that the other router was having issues so the connections were varying in speed.  For us Eero is worth every dollar as Internet peace reigns supreme in our home.  Thanks to everyone who wrote real reviews prior to my purchase as they helped me make my purchase decision.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TX180B7FYTDR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3D79BWGLL8MFP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"david renton",19-Feb-2017,5,"Made an enormous positive change at our house","Having spent money over and over on various wifi extenders, it was a joy to be able to install this product quite easily and for it to work really well, just about instantaneously.The concept is elegant, you add more if you need to, and I believe they all take care of the housekeeping between them, handing you from one to the other as you move around your house.No more waiting while my device hunts for a different supplier of the same wifi signal while it switches from the main wifi to the range extender.No more 'the server timed out because your device appears to be offline' messages. I would always think ""I didn't stop paying for that internet - it's still there, and I shouldn't have to coax a device into communicating with my router"".Also the design is pleasing, the squared-off white hockey puck doesn't look like much wherever it's placed, and the cord from the bit that plugs into the wall outlet is long enough that you have placement options.It's also cool that you can programmatically turn off the little white 'on' light","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2POPD42BFGH7J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2OZ2OXUBK5SKK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"Dan Wheeler",19-Feb-2017,2,"Immediately returning due to cell phone number requirement","I just received this in the mail and unfortunately will now be returning it after finding out the setup process requires you to enter your phone number so they can send you a code via text to authenticate you. This is a deal breaker for me so back it goes. I called their support to confirm and I will say, I got a real human, on a weekend, who spoke perfect English, within about a minute and no complicated menus, so that was cool. But still - he said there's no way to do set up without a cell phone number.I'm just going to pick up some WiFi APs from the local electronics store, put them in bridge mode and put them on the existing wired network. The way this system works, it takes the place of your router and I use my router's NAT features for a few wired home automation services, cameras, gaming, etc. so I wouldn't be able to use the routing function of these access points anyway. They basically end up acting as expensive, bridges WiFi access points. Even if I were using the Eeros access points as routers, I don't really buy the claim that the home router is the bottleneck. Doesn't seem to make sense that a gigabit router would be the bottleneck on a 50Mb Comcast circuit. But hey, I'm no network engineer, who knows.Mostly annoyed about the phone number though. Lame.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38GZ8DUO300AZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A4SNDKSMS51AD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"David S.",19-Feb-2017,5,"Solve your home wifi problems once and for all with this unit!","This new technology is as good an improvement as I could have hoped for.  I have Comcast high speed internet, very fast and I use the latest Apple Airport Extreme for my router.  We have a large house (3700 square feet) and we have many bad spots with poor speed.  For example my Apple Macbook Air in our kitchen sometimes is as slow as 2-5 mbps, while if I put the laptop next to the router (which is upstairs) I can get 100-175 mbps.  I also noticed that Apple has announced they are getting out of the router business--that suggested to me they realize their technology isn't keeping up and perhaps they don't want to invest in this area.  So I bought the 3-pack Eero and set it up, total time probably 20-25 minutes.  I chose to sort of triangulate my house, two units upstairs at each end of the house and one in the kitchen.  Despite the fact that Eero says it may take 24 hours to get up to full speed I am getting 125-175 mbps everywhere---yeehaa!  My Facetime to London was better and my Ring doorbell videos are much better.  One tip for setting it up:  Eero said to plug in the first unit and the modem simultaneously,  but the Comcast modem takes about a minute to connect so the Eero unit seemed to be struggling to connect.  I would suggest plugging in the modem first, let it show all the lights up and running, then plug in the Eero.  One other thought; some online reviews complain about the somewhat higher price of the Eero vs. Google wifi versus Orbi for example.  I think this is a mistake.  Having the best and fastest wifi in one's home is about as important as anything you have running in your house.  I am willing to pay extra for the best solution which this clearly is.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36KMB5YHQ5SD3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A32OP25V8S8WZT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Amazon Customer",19-Feb-2017,5,"Chord cutters dream","I picked eero to upgrade my wifi. I had an older Apple airport and was waiting for the next generation of Airports. Apple instead discontinued their Airports. I was a little hesitant at the switch to eero. I've used non Apple routers before, and was somewhat dreading the set up. I opened the box and then down loaded the app to my iPhone. It walked me through the set up like a stroll in the park. Set up number one, then it asked if I wanted to do another and then again for the third. I options for network control were easy to see and work. Family member restrictions for the children were easier than on the airport. The look and feel was more Apple like than Apples own products. I wish I'd switched earlier. Streaming to my AppleTVs has improved with less buffering. Streaming live TV through my HDHomerun extend has improved markedly. For people considering chord cutting that have multiple TVs, eero is a must have upgrade for your wifi.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BUZNX29NXUDD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A207J15HNH4HA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
