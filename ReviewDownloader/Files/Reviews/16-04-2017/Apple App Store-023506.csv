"Hubbz127",14-Apr-2017,4,"Great delivery app!","I love GrubHub because it makes it really simple to order and I've always had a great experience. I give it a 4 because if a restaurant is closed you can't view the menu and prepare an order for later when it opens up. Also not a massive fan of the minimum order requirements and all the fees.

It was my first time ordering through grub hub , and I ordered sushi with rice and miso soup, by the time I got my food (45 mins later than the delivery service estimated the time to be ) it was cold soggy mushy it smelled of rotten fish and was saturated in lemon juice to keep the avocados from going bad.

Most recent experience will be my last. Their drivers screwed up my &50 order and 2 hours later I was still on the phone with ""customer service"" who only offered me a &10 voucher for my troubles, the worst part was my kids only received one order and I still hadn't eaten.

"Schmekoman",12-Apr-2017,2,"Ehh","GrubHub is great because it tends to be a little less expensive than its competitors (e.g. Door Dash and Uber Eats) however, that being said, their customer service is sub-par. Actually, it's embarrassingly inadequate. As I recall, I placed an order, and the delivery time kept being pushed back, and not due to the restaurant's incompetency. The driver was so late picking up the order, the store had already closed. Eventually I was able to get things straight with the ""customer service"" department and the food was delivered. As a token of ""I'm sorry"", the delivery guy gave me a &10 coupon to use on my next order. At that point I was pleased. It seemed that GrubHub took the initiative to rectify the situation. The next time I placed an order, I was happy to use this coupon, and to my dismay, the coupon was indeed a &10 discount.... for first time orders only. What am I supposed to do with that? Use it as a napkin? So basically at the end of the day, GrubHub did not rectify anything... which is a disappointment, because the service they offer is of value. It's just too bad that they don't care about their customers.","",""

They did send me a text saying my food was late and they ""gave me free grub"" which turned out to be chips. I gave them another star just for the notification.

For the two years I've been using it, my main complaint is that the app doesn't display restaurant hours and will still allow you to order from closed restaurants. So you end up ordering food and then it never shows up until the next morning (or sometimes not at all).
It's happened around 6-7 times, so I've taken to checking google for the hours and calling the restaurant if it's within an hour of closing time.

"Simple, intuitive...THE BEST",05-Apr-2017,5,"GrubHub to all, and to all a good night!","'Twas the morn after drinking when all through the night
Not a brain cell was stirring, and my stomach felt light
When the keg had been kicked and the liquor run dry, 
The thought of pizza caused a twinkle in my eye
And not just a pizza of the literal shroud,
But a metaphor for options all found in the cloud!
With Grace on the floor and Joe's head in the sink,
I used all my strength and tried hard just to think...
""Is it best for the group"", I thought to myself,
""to eat pizza or wings on the cheap or top shelf?""
And so began the Sisyphusean struggle
To get a consensus out of a drunken huddle.
From the floor: ""Wings from Axis!""  Grace zealously squeals
From the sink: ""Pizza from..."" [Joe throws up as he kneels]
""I want a milkshake!"" comes loudly from the right
On the left: ""You got a milkshake at the club just last night!""
From somewhere above: ""Can't we all just get along?""
From below: ""Hell no, his choice is so wrong!""
And that's when I choose to come intervene:
""Guys, settle down, we're living the dream!
In the olden days, when the world was 2D,
You had to call and order, not tap on a screen!
So why do we argue, or say someone's wrong?
In drunk eating, we all win! So sing the same song!""
The group grew silent, save Joe throwing up
They all looked at each other, and said ""Order up!""
GrubHub to the rescue! We all chose our meals
And 40 minutes later, they arrived on 4 wheels!
As we all quite savagely tore into our platter,
Grace sulked in the corner, so I asked ""What's the matter?""
""We never said Grace! This food is a blessing!""
""Grace!"" Yelled Kevin, face full of Ranch Dressing.
""No, she's right,"" said Joe, ""appreciate we must,
for the good fortune that GrubHub to us did entrust.""

and for incredible service, we give you 5 stars!","",""

I kindly declined, requesting a discount code for tonight instead (obviously I wanted to maximize the benefit they offered to me by placing an even larger order tonight, something for which a 50% discount on the previous order falls short from my perspective). No can do, they said, despite my forwarding the promotional email to them upon request and supplying a qualifying order number. Not wanting to fight, I agreed and told them I wouldn't do business with them again either tonight nor in the future because they aren't willing to honor the explicit terms of their own promotions. Generating a new discount code should be easy and instantaneous, but I think they knew I wanted to place an even larger order tonight, so they chose to offer me the shaft instead in order to save themselves a few bucks on a promotion they willingly offered to me. Not smart. Instead, they have lost my business permanently. Such a shame, as I like the concept and would love to use it for those frequent evenings after work in which I'm too tired and/or lazy to cook or go out.

When the driver kept calling me, he refused to deliver my food to me and the restaurant refused to refund my money.

In some locations in the US where there are few delivery options, GrubHub provides a desperately needed service. They also seem to be pretty aggressive about growing that service‚Äî new restaurants are added seemingly every week. 

As far as the app, which we're here to review, 95% of the time it has worked like a champ. Quick ordering, good UI, and Apple Pay. One night it was messing up and I couldn't do anything but order from past orders. Other than that it's been reliable and great, and a joy to use. 

If you haven't checked out GrubHub yet give it a whirl, you won't be disappointed.","",""

Where the app fails is in giving a picture of each food item in the menu. For a lot of foods I don't really know what it looks like by its title but you know it once you see a picture of it. Most restaurants when you come to pick up your food will read play the order just to make sure before you leave I don't see why this isn't something that GrubHub delivery drivers are unable to do.

I called GrubHub and had an 8 minute wait of elevator music just to talk to customer service.  I told them I was missing an item. They told me that they would refund that portion of my bill BUT THEY DO NOT RE-DELIVER MISSING ITEMS. They blamed the restaurant and said that the drivers do not check the order before they deliver it ""because that's not their job"". GrubHub requires a tip at time of order instead of completion of service, which in my opinion as an experienced server compromises the service standard. I gave the driver a 20% tip prior to receiving my food and was not refunded for that portion. I recommend Eat-Out-In. They always check the order and bring extra condiments and napkins and will re-deliver if anything is incorrect. In the end, my husband ended up splitting his burrito with our guest.

":)Lauren:)",14-Mar-2017,5,"Such an Amazing App","When I first downloaded this app only a few restaurants around me were listed as delivery options. After I placed my order the restaurant not only messed up my order but were very rude to us about it and Grubhub completely refunded me even though it was all the restaurant's fault. They have added more restaurants and their customer service is amazing. I love being able to order food to my home without a crazy delivery fee. Grubhub is one of my favorite apps on my phone.","",""

"Nikkilynn1985",14-Mar-2017,1,"Horrible","This app constantly cancels my orders after it appears to have gone through. It'll even give me an estimated delivery time and then five to ten minutes later I'll get a ""whoops email"". I'll stick to eat24 from now on.","",""

"SkinnyMackin",14-Mar-2017,1,"Negative Experience","First time trying this app. Terrible experience. They waited until after my food was estimated to be delivered before letting me know my order had been cancelled. I placed another order and it appeared not to go through so I tried again and suddenly got 2 confirmations. Called in to customer service and he kept insisting that it was my fault. Really who cares whose fault it is but just a bad customer experience. I work for an app. If my CS team talked to people like ""David"" did, they'd be fired that's for sure.","",""
