"Brett Stark",25-Feb-2016,5,"","Pretty amazing so far.  Setup of a new router / wifi system usually takes some time, and then you have to get ahold of everyone in the household and update their devices.  Not so with this app and the eero devices.  Setup took 10 minutes to have all three eero boxes in place and working with this app.    Notifying everyone in the house of the change is done in the app with text or email notifications.  I didn't even have to speak to anyone other than to tell them ahead of time that a new network would be coming up.  Connectivity is spectacular.    I had several dead spots in my house before eero.  This was mostly due to the wifi router plus extender system that most people use.  Every corner of my house now has excellent wifi signal strength and you never have to switch from one device to another.    As far as speed is concerned, I had 4 FireTV sticks playing HD video, 6 phones browsing, and 3 computers playing Youtube videos last night, and there was no buffering or waiting.
