"L. D. Weller",15-Apr-2017,5,"Very happy with purchase","Finally my family is no longer complaining about WiFi access speeds.  Compared to Small Office/Home Office routers which I've purchased over the years this product was easy to set up and configure and works reliably. Very happy and have recommended it to co-workers and friends who have family embers frustrated with lack of signal in some parts of the house.  I was a little concerned about maintaining enough bandwidth for VOIP but have had no problems so far.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RR14Q259GDYT2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AYDSCPPWPXF9S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"Baradanikto",15-Apr-2017,5,"Replacement for Three TP-Link range extenders","I bought the three unit mesh network to replace three TP-Link POE range extenders.  The range extenders would occasionally drop signals and force me to use a different SSID when I needed a better signal (depending upon the location).  The eero units worked out of the box and provided much better and stronger coverage than the range extenders.  Setup was easy using my Android smartphone.  The only problem I had was with my  Canon wireless printer.  The eero installation sets up a new network with a different IP address scheme.  After installation, I could no longer print because the printer was not &#34;discovered&#34;.  I had to reset the printer settings and re-install the drivers after pulling the plugs on two eero units.  I needed to pull the plugs because the eero units use the same SSID for each unit.  The printer install would not let me install initially because of the duplicate SSIDs.  Temporarily removing two eero units allowed me to connect the printer to a single unit and finish the install.  Once the printer install was done, I re-plugged the two units and all is well.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2EMNXRZICW3O8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A7KCAN9VNVOBX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"RoadRage",14-Apr-2017,4,"Your mileage may vary","I struggle w/ 4 or 5 stars. I am a engineer and my network maybe was a bit different then the intended audience and I want to be fair if this is at all the cause for my challenges. That being said, if you are looking for a simple to use wifi mesh that will cover a large square footage home, this is a great product and dead simple to install. My only complaint is after initial install the app stated that &#34;Everything Looks Good&#34; although I was unable to pass traffic from any wireless connected device. It was not until I went into &#34;Help--&#62;My Internet is slow--&#62;Run Health Check&#34; that there was a sign of an issue. I just found this very misleading and as a technical person I did know howto logically troubleshoot but would my friend or family member or would this be a call to the guy who recommends it, me ? The other issue was an undocumented feature that suddenly appeared after a software update that now my wireless devices can not converse with my wired devices, this presents an issue because my wired device is my desktop/media server and now none of my devices can do app hand off in spotify to my desktop.  Another EXCELLENT win for this solution is support, I spoke with a girl who was extremely knowledgeable and courteous and would say this is the best consumer network device support in the industry right now.  Please keep in mind, if you have a very simple cable modem and wireless setup, you may have no issues but I have a cable modem, router, switch, wired VoIP, wired desktops, and now Eero for wifi and there are some challenges.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28HK5MKP0EFZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/ALM31S9O8EWW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"wsconn1",09-Apr-2017,4,"Set up was very easy. The only problem I had was that after ...","These appear to have resolved a problem of spotty wifi around my house.  Set up was very easy.  The only problem I had was that after getting these set up, they auto-updated the software and the app got frozen -- although the eeros themselves were working.  I finally deleted the app and reinstalled it and everything has been good since then.  I am surprised that I do get an occasional message when trying to use my iPad and my Apple TV, both in the same room as an eero, telling me that the signal is too weak.  There is a clear line of sight between all three devices and the Apple TV is close to the eero but a bit lower.  I'll experiment a bit with placement and assume this will be resolved.  Regardless, I would recommend these because of the design, ease of set up and blanket coverage elsewhere in my house.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R367T67OMQQIWF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AH6CRBKET7IFC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

I read online that everyone says they are very warm when on so I decided not to risk future failures and have decided to try the Linksys Velop system.

"Crabbzilla",02-Apr-2017,5,"Finally, Hassle Free WiFI that Simply Works!","I purchased the 3 pack in July 2016 and I've had absolutely no issues with them whatsoever. I cannot say the same for the&nbsp;NETGEAR Nighthawk AC1900 Dual Band Wi-Fi Gigabit Router (R7000) with Open Source Support. Compatible with Amazon Echo/Alexa&nbsp;that I purchased in January 2015 and its companion, the&nbsp;NETGEAR Nighthawk AC1900 Desktop WiFi Range Extender (EX7000-100NAS)&nbsp;purchased in June 2015. At the time, I thought I was out of my mind spending $400 on the eero Home WiFi System (it would've been $500 at the time, but Amazon offered a promo of $100 off), especially considering the amount of money I had already spent on the Netgear Nighthawk equipment. While the Netgear equipment provided fast throughput, I clearly decided 6 mos after purchasing the router that I needed an extender. Also, by 2016 I was experiencing dropouts all the time to the point that I routinely had to cycle the router nearly every day. I could not for the life of me figure out what was going on w/the Netgear router. I was so frustrated that I simply had to try the eero Home WiFi System. To date, I've had no dropouts; no need to cycle power - the eero simply works and is frustration free. I have one in second floor my home office, one in my upstairs bedroom, and the third in a cabinet (supposedly a no-no re: reception) that house my gaming systems, DVR, etc. There are currently 23 connected devices including 2 desktops, 3 laptops, 2 tablets, 3 cell phones, 4 Sonos speakers, 3 streaming devices, 3 Arlo cameras, 1 Ring doorbell camera (which prompted the purchase of the Netgear Extender), multiple Hue lightbulbs, etc. etc. When needed and in use, everything that is on my network works and works well. I never experience buffering issues when streaming music or TV. Web pages load quickly and multiplayer gaming is lag free. I also have a strong signal in my front and back yard! (I'm using this with Comcast Blast Plus!I also like that they are low profile and simply elegant compared to the beastly size and unattractive look of my old Netgear equipment (currently housed in a drawer until I figure out what to do with them). The only draw back I can think of is that there is only one ethernet port. However, that problem is easily solved through the purchase of an ethernet switching device such as the one I purchased for roughly $10:&nbsp;NETGEAR 5-Port Fast Ethernet 10/100Mbps Switch (FS205).  Oh - and I initially had an issue in which I had a problem getting eero to work with my employer's VPN and customer support was quick, friendly and solved the problem. That was the one and only problem I've had with these. All in all, If you're looking for a hassle free solution to router/WiFi issues and you don't mind that you're not going to be able to tweak various settings like QOS, then the eero system is the way to go. Frankly, I don't miss looking at or tweaking the various settings on Netgear's software - I really don't have a need to with the eero since it works as expected. Which is to say that the eero Home Wifi System exceeded my expectations and was definitely worth the expense in order to achieve hassle free WiFi throughout my home (including the yard, attic and basement). Highly, highly recommended.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RIE9270DQORZL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2PO4VFBUEUOI5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"L. Liroff",01-Apr-2017,5,"Very Satisfied.  Easy Set Up.  Works well with Apple Express","I had an existing WiFi with an Apple Time Capsule supplemented by Apple Express's throughout my 2100 square foot, two story house.  The system wasn't working.  Typically, upstairs I was getting speeds in the neighborhood of 3 to 5 mbps.  Not satisfactory to run Airplay well.  So I bought an Eero 3 pack.  Set up was so easy.  Really.  I mean really.  I had trouble getting my Apple Express connected to the Eero system so I could continue to run Airplay.  I got great help from Eero's call center from Nick who talked me through it.  Now my system works seamlessly.  My Apple Express are connected to my Eero Wifi and Apple Airplay works perfectly every time.  Plus I was able to, with Nick's help, connect my Apple Time Capsule to my system so it keeps backing up my system.

"Kevin Haggard",31-Mar-2017,3,"eero Mesh Wifi Not Magic - Don't Buy If Existing Wifi Setup Works","I purchased these on the hype to replace a set of 3 Apple Airport Express and 1 Apple Airport Extreme that blanketed my house. I had a few problems with moving to room to room on WiFi with the Apple set-up so was willing to try the mesh wifi world. All 4 of my eero's are connected to a switch at home which is connected to the router - which is the same setup I used with the Apple Airports. The couple of issues I have had are:- eero units randomly flashing red lights and not being available - this could be for a few seconds or longer- not playing well with multiple WeMo devices and switches throughout the house- I have had multiple occasions where the wired Internet speeds are 45 Mbps and the eero speeds are less than 10 Mbps with no activity in the houseOn the plus side - I think the iOS software is nicely done.TL;DR - I bought the hype on these units - but don't think the premium is justified. Stick with your old wifi setup if it works. This will not magically make everything better i.e. unicorns riding on rainbows will not deliver stable and fast Internet speeds to every corner of your house.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDATHHYN2HMNG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AU35JOCRE0NGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"Steven D. Arnold",31-Mar-2017,5,"Best-of-breed wifi solution. Excellent!","I've tried many different wifi base stations over time. Most of them were somewhere between decent and unusable. Even high-quality vendors, like Apple's Airport, still kicked my devices and my family's off the network or didn't give good coverage throughout the house (which has four floors), thus resulting in poor or no performance in many cases. I have young children who sometimes watch movies on an iPad, so bad connectivity translates directly to an unpleasant day for me. I have to have a solution that works.One idea I had was to put a different wifi router in each part of the house, hardwired via ethernet. The downside with this is if you connect to the one on the top floor with your phone, and then you walk downstairs, your connectivity is bad. So an interesting idea, but not really practical. And don't even start me on extenders. In my experience, they're all terrible, assuming they work at all, which is often not the case.eevo really solves this problem and does a great job. I got the package of three base stations. I have my own internal network and don't want to connect the eevo directly to the Internet, so I set it up in bridged mode and made it serve a range of DHCP IP addresses. (Note: these are advanced settings, but it's nice to know it's possible to do this.) In my case, all three base stations were connected to house ethernet, which probably helps, but this is not technically necessary, according to eevo. (I did not test this, because I'm happy with my current configuration, and I'm sure at any rate that ethernet will be faster..)The three base stations merged seamlessly into a single wifi network, available throughout the house. The network offers very strong signal (all bars) everywhere. It's the same network, so there's no need to connect to a different network in a different part of the house. The speed is excellent, very comparable to the best wifi routers I've used in the past. And neither I, nor my wife and kids, ever get kicked off the network. It's extremely stable.It did take me a while to figure out I really wanted bridged networking. I just needed eevo to give me wifi DHCP access to my own network, nothing fancy beyond that. Also, the eevo documentation insists that you must plug your primary eevo directly into the service provider's modem, bypassing any firewalls etc, but this is not in fact necessary -- or I should say it might be necessary if your firewall is set up in an overly restrictive manner, but it was not a problem for me. (It might well also have been a problem if bridged networking had not been a sufficient solution for me.) I guess the point here is the docs are less than clear about this.Overall, eevo provides exceptional service in signal, in speed, and in stability, far better for a whole-house solution than anything else I've ever tried -- and I've tried many, many different things over the years. It's a clear winner and if your needs and problems match those I described, I strongly recommend that you give eevo a try.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OZ1PWMU91ULK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1VCZU26BQI13/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

My first attempts failed on a successful mesh network using AT&amp;T Uverse DSL, I followed the setup process and googled and tried what others suggested. Eero just did not work as advertised on AT&amp;T.Fast forward to 6 months later after being frustrated with AT&amp;T speeds I switched over to Wave Broadband and got the 250 Mbps down and 10 Mbps package. Initially I took there generic cable modem/wifi router. What a disappointment, I had better speeds than with AT&amp;T however I was not getting what I paid for. So I decide to purchase my own cable modem (Arris SB6190 Surfboard) and the eero system again. After a few kinks getting everything setup and the eero updates they system has been working flawlessly. I now have complete mesh wifi coverage at full speeds and more in my entire house.

While they started out slower than the linksys, they were still fast enough for everything we needed. The problem comes that within a week or two the speed drops off to almost nothing. I had my macbook pro literally 2 feet from one of the hardwired base stations. I was getting 2mbps. I restarted the base station (which requires you to unplug/plug it back in). After it came back up, I was getting 180mbps again. Not having to restart the eeros was the only reason I bought them (i.e. rock solid wifi). Their support was fairly good, but we never could get them to work 100%. So, I returned them. At this point, I'm back to using 4 airport extremes (all hardwired) around my house.

It served me well for years; however, I could never get a solid wifi signal throughout my home, nor the performance throughput I was paying for with Comcast.Got tired of my wife complaining about as the signal degradation the past year. Watch the Eero video on their web site.....it is spot on. I was doing everything the guy in the video was doing. I purchased Eero's products, because I didn't want to deal with a non-consumer friendly, poorly designed, and less than stellar performance networking solution. I did look at competing mesh networking products, but chose Eero for the favorable customer experience.Set-up was as easy as everyone has written about. Just plug the devices in as instructed, and everything was recognized by their iOS app. Took a few minutes on my devices were all online. I kept my same network name as my old one and the same network password, so all my devices were recognized.Only task I had to do was update the firmware. The firmware update done via their iOS app and the network worked perfectly after upgrade. The only extra thing I did was assign a unique name to every device on my network. I did not care if I didn't have all the configuration parameters like I did with my Apple set-up, because I never used the overly technical settings to begin with.I now have 17 unique devices on the network with no reported problems. This includes one Nest thermostat, three Nest smoke alarms, one Apple time machine network drive, two iPads, two iPhones, one Apple TV, one Amazon Fire stick, one Apple iMac, one Apple MacBook Pro, and a five others for good measure. No lags, no offline conditions, etc. It appears to just work.Observations:- Easy to install and set-up.- Eero constantly improving their software and features. Very easy to see how committed they are to making this a best in class product.- iOS app is straight forward. No bloated app design. They keep it simple and clean. No way to get lost in it.- App allows you to turn off the device indicator light.- Covers my two-story home with consistent high throughput wifi coverage.- Responsive customer service. When one of my devices failed after 48 hrs. I called Eero and got a live person who spoke English...they shipped a replacement device immediately. All I had to do was return the defective device in the package with pre-paid shipping label. Easy.- Easy online Help information. Again, information is easy to find/search for, well composed, and offers easy to follow instructions.- Delivers a consistent and available connection across my 2200 foot two story home. Check out the awesome performance I am getting in the picture I posted.Misc.- One satellite device failed after 48 hrs, but Eero replaced it immediately (thank you Eero).- When checking the wifi performance via the iOS app, it is not clear how the network speed results are determined. It would be nice know which device it is testing the network throughput from. When I test with Speedtest.net, I get a totally different network performance number. I don't know why. Maybe another user can enlighten me. I did notice when I check the network speed on multiple devices with the Eero app....they all activate. Interesting, no issue on that, just my curiosity why?- I wish the devices were smaller in footprint like the Apple Airport Express.No showstoppers, a positive customer experience, and my wife is happy with her husband again.Thank you Eero, keep up the good work!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1E4AZST9CPNCP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1T5BC1E4NESOY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Steven",24-Mar-2017,5,"Best WiFi I have ever owned!","My house was built in 1969.  It is a double split-level and has steel beams in between the floors.  It has been near impossible to get acceptable WiFi in my house since we moved here in 2003.  I have spent hundreds, maybe thousands of dollars in attempts to get WiFi to cover most most of my house.  Multiple zones and APs.  Powered antennas.  WiFi boosters.  Nothing worked well.  I have been using ethernet over power adapters up until now because of this.  I had attempted to use mesh routers in the past, but they were enterprise class and too expensive or hard to manage.  So eero has been a breath of fresh air.  They have been exactly as they were described.  I love the fact that there is no manual.  Just download the app and go.  I plugged the first into my gigabit router, worked as expected.  The next one I was expecting issues.  I have had so many problem going from the office to the living room.  Number 2, no issue.  Wow!  Ok, number 3 in the upstairs solarium.  No issue.  I could not believe it.  There are no more dead spaces in my house.  No more putting my phone outside the kitchen to play streaming music because I couldn't get coverage.  Before eero I had also recently moved to gigabit ethernet for my internet service and was so disappointed that I was getting a fraction of the speed to my devices.  It seemed like a complete waste.  Now I am getting optimal speeds for the wireless technology and actually seeing the difference in having gigabit.  I've already recommended to a friend and he bought there right then and there based on my testimony alone.  I can easily say, these are the best WiFi routers I have ever owned and I no longer worry about if my WiFi is working.  Thanks eero!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FWAWYKVH4HM5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3CWRR1SL9ZNFP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

However if you want to locate them in a cabinet you will need to take measures to avoid overheating.  I put rubber feet on the units to increase ground clearance and drilled some discreet ventilation holes in the cabinet.

"Bill",18-Mar-2017,5,"Great purchase, Highly recommend","This is simply an exceptional product.  In summary, it was relatively easy to set up and provides strong, fast coverage across my home.  Prior to installing, download the app and set your phone to cellular with bluetooth on (turn off wifi on your phone).  Follow directions setting up the base device (I believe they are exactly the same but I will refer to the 1st device as the base).  You might want to conduct a software update at this time but I'm not sure it really matters.  Let the app lead you thru the set up of your satellite devices which should be line of sight and 40 feet or so away.  I did run into problems with the second phase as I was experiencing a bluetooth glitch.  I eventually called tech support which was fantastic!  They quickly answered and solved the issue.  The completion of the set up was a breeze from that point on.  I was told that this wasn't a common issue but its nice to know that the support line was this good.  I was working off of an Apple time capsule prior to installing the Eero device and it lost coverage and speed across the my house.  The difference is simply striking!  I could average 5 - 20 Mbs download depending upon the room I was in except for the extreme points in the house where is was a crap shot as to signal.  Now my coverage is 25 - 40 Mbs in the far reaches of my home.  Note: the Eero app seems to test your potential speed not the actual speed (it seems to regularly give 60Mbs as metric).  So I was using another speed test.

How good are they? My family runs three DVRs, and a wifi- capable TV, three laptops and various tablets in my house. Even with all of that the speed is consistently high in all my locations.They were the easiest to install networks as well.

"milodaman",15-Mar-2017,1,"Product issues and dubious company policies","&nbsp;I hate to have to write this review as I really wanted these Eero's to work. However, as it turns out, my old apple airports never had the issues I experienced until I switched over to Eero. Once I switched back to the old airports, all the following issues went away.Frequent DropsAs seen in the attached video, you'll notice that the throughput goes up and down every 30-45 seconds, which is significant enough that it causes streaming music to pause frequently. Of course streaming video was a non-starter. I spent over a month trying to debug this with Eero support with no luck. Note that this issue happens no matter the distance to the access point.ConnectivityMost of my devices connect fine. However, I have a couple of devices that seem to have connectivity problems on a regular bases. One of my MacBook Pro's required me to hard code an IP in order to maintain a connection. Same issue was found with an iPad as well. Note that this issue happens no matter the distance to the access point.CompanyIt's also important to note that I tried to work with the company to resolve these issues for a couple of months. I started the process with Eero Support within the first month, creating videos and providing long detailed explanations regarding the behaviors. They logged into my devices remotely to monitor the behavior and also sent me a custom firmware.  However, now that it seems like they won't be able to fix the issues, I asked for a refund. However, eero refused because they said it was over a month since I purchased the product. I explained that this hardly seemed fair given I, in good faith, worked with their support organization to resolve their product issues, conversations which started BEFORE the month mark. I would recommend folks thinking about purchasing an eero make sure you quickly confirm the performance of the product and return the product right away if any issues are all are found instead of working with Support given this policy.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37EQ6K8IQ6LD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3OMP7FQM82DCP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"G. Thompson",12-Mar-2017,5,"Excellent signal strength; Idiot-Proof Installation","We had an older WiFi with an extender that gave us constant headaches -- we often had to unplug the units several times a day and signal strength was uneven throughout our large house. After doing research on the eero vs. Google's unit, we decided on the eero not only because of the good reviews (in Amazon and in the technical press) but also because Google requires you to make the unit part of the ever-creeping Google ecosystem that watches everything you do in searches, emails, and the like, and adds it to the profile it keeps for you in order to sell ads more targeted to how they have you categorized. I would rather have my WiFi system just do its work without whispering about me to Google in the background!The system is dead easy to set up -- literally, we just plugged and played, following the directions in the app. It worked right out of the box. Since installing eero, we have had flawless service - no interruptions and signal strength throughout the house is high.The design of the units is sleek and unobtrusive. Although we didn't need to ask for help, apparently the support offered is excellent.This works as well as any modern internet product we have put into service in recent years.

I have 20+ devices on my network and for some reason the EERO does not want to allow outbound connection originating from my Honeywell Thermostat.Calls to Support at EERO has been extremely frustrating because the Support at EERO is not well support by EERO's engineering team.

EERO support claims it will stay up as long as you don't reboot, but I've found that doesn't seem to be at all true.  And of course, you can't do anything, even check on the status if they are showing the red light.  This is the WRONG WAY to design these things.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3D5TGHWHXF8VF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3LJFKNSSD86R4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

I have each of them connected to the backbone using Netgear PLP1200 Powerline adapters, so the communication between units is very fast.  I get full upload/download speed via my ISP and extremely fast communication between computers inside my home.Unfortunately, I did run into a limitation.  I like to use a non-standard network range inside my house.  This way, when I travel with my laptop, the hotel will not assign me an IP address from that range, so the personal firewall will not think it is on my home network.  The eero configuration will only let me choose addresses from RFC 1918 (10.0.0.0, 172.16.0.0 or 192.168.0.0).  I prefer to use 6.6.6.0 /24 since I figure no hotel would ever assign me an IP from that range.  I have done this for years using various routers, but the DHCP settings of the eero just will not allow it.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MU3YQ8L3UW65/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A26SNCU5287VJT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

As soon as you got a good 20-30 feet from the unit it all went downhill.  We're in a highly congested building in NYC so there's a ton of channel contention.  We considered business-class mesh hardware/software from all of the major manufacturers; Ubiquity, Ruckus, etc.  Unfortunately the pricing and learning curve was going to be substantially more than we were willing to invest.  After much debate we decided to buy six eero units and place them throughout the office in bridge mode.  We couldn't be happier!!!  Setup was unbelievably easy and the system is very reliable.  We regularly have anywhere between 50 to 70 devices (combination of Nest cameras, tablets, phones, and laptops) connected to the system and performance/throughput is solid.We get it, these aren't necessarily meant for business use but quite honestly, if you're a small business and don't want to hire an engineer to install and maintain expensive hardware this may work for you.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3L4HM81UP430I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AG8P99C7CUQD5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"D. Day",20-Feb-2017,1,"Bad for remote access.","It's not working at all for remote database access.  Nothing needed to be configured on the previous Apple AirPort Extreme to allow remote access.  However with Eero, we had to set up port forwarding.  After the port forwarding set up, it got messier from there.  We were only able to access the database from out-of-home network or cell data.  When we are in the Eero network, we'll receive a server not reachable error message.  Eero tech support said they will consider this feature.  I am not sure what feature they are talking about.It's a great device if you are only using it for web, email, and other stuff.  But I'd avoid it if you need any remote access to your home network.

"Computer Geek",20-Feb-2017,5,"Thanks eero for a great product!","Absolutely excellent technology.  We were using a high-end router and 3 extenders in an effort to obtain consistent speeds.  The install is easy and the app is very well-designed.  We have as many as 25 connected devices including computers, tablets, TVs, Amazon Echos (5 of them!), Ring doorbells & cameras, Hue lights, WEMO switches etc. and the network is rock solid.  There is no more yelling from our son's area in the far end of the house.  Note we have a house with older and probably odd construction so even line-of-sight from the old router wasn't working too well.  As I write this we are getting 109 down Mbps / 12 up.  The most I've noticed is 115 down.  No more daily router reboots from the cable modem in fact I haven't rebooted them at all since installation.  Netflix performance is very much improved and rarely goes out.  My guess is that the other router was having issues so the connections were varying in speed.  For us Eero is worth every dollar as Internet peace reigns supreme in our home.

This is a deal breaker for me so back it goes. I called their support to confirm and I will say, I got a real human, on a weekend, who spoke perfect English, within about a minute and no complicated menus, so that was cool. But still - he said there's no way to do set up without a cell phone number.I'm just going to pick up some WiFi APs from the local electronics store, put them in bridge mode and put them on the existing wired network. The way this system works, it takes the place of your router and I use my router's NAT features for a few wired home automation services, cameras, gaming, etc. so I wouldn't be able to use the routing function of these access points anyway. They basically end up acting as expensive, bridges WiFi access points. Even if I were using the Eeros access points as routers, I don't really buy the claim that the home router is the bottleneck. Doesn't seem to make sense that a gigabit router would be the bottleneck on a 50Mb Comcast circuit. But hey, I'm no network engineer, who knows.Mostly annoyed about the phone number though.

"David S.",19-Feb-2017,5,"Solve your home wifi problems once and for all with this unit!","This new technology is as good an improvement as I could have hoped for.  I have Comcast high speed internet, very fast and I use the latest Apple Airport Extreme for my router.  We have a large house (3700 square feet) and we have many bad spots with poor speed.  For example my Apple Macbook Air in our kitchen sometimes is as slow as 2-5 mbps, while if I put the laptop next to the router (which is upstairs) I can get 100-175 mbps.  I also noticed that Apple has announced they are getting out of the router business--that suggested to me they realize their technology isn't keeping up and perhaps they don't want to invest in this area.  So I bought the 3-pack Eero and set it up, total time probably 20-25 minutes.  I chose to sort of triangulate my house, two units upstairs at each end of the house and one in the kitchen.  Despite the fact that Eero says it may take 24 hours to get up to full speed I am getting 125-175 mbps everywhere---yeehaa!  My Facetime to London was better and my Ring doorbell videos are much better.  One tip for setting it up:  Eero said to plug in the first unit and the modem simultaneously,  but the Comcast modem takes about a minute to connect so the Eero unit seemed to be struggling to connect.  I would suggest plugging in the modem first, let it show all the lights up and running, then plug in the Eero.  One other thought; some online reviews complain about the somewhat higher price of the Eero vs. Google wifi versus Orbi for example.  I think this is a mistake.  Having the best and fastest wifi in one's home is about as important as anything you have running in your house.  I am willing to pay extra for the best solution which this clearly is.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36KMB5YHQ5SD3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A32OP25V8S8WZT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

Apple instead discontinued their Airports. I was a little hesitant at the switch to eero. I've used non Apple routers before, and was somewhat dreading the set up. I opened the box and then down loaded the app to my iPhone. It walked me through the set up like a stroll in the park. Set up number one, then it asked if I wanted to do another and then again for the third. I options for network control were easy to see and work. Family member restrictions for the children were easier than on the airport. The look and feel was more Apple like than Apples own products. I wish I'd switched earlier. Streaming to my AppleTVs has improved with less buffering. Streaming live TV through my HDHomerun extend has improved markedly. For people considering chord cutting that have multiple TVs, eero is a must have upgrade for your wifi.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BUZNX29NXUDD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A207J15HNH4HA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

The company service team is also top notch, via email or the phone. the ability to run tests remotely, check at your configuration, reboot the network its great.

"Amazon Customer",16-Feb-2017,5,"Seamless operation & full home coverage","Even though I had purchased a high end router, I found I still needed to use a range extender ((also high end) to cover all areas of our 1800 sq ft main level with full basement home. I was having two continuing issues. First issue, I was having to reboot the system often, sometimes more than once daily. Secondly, because I had the router in the basement and the range extender on the main level, when I walked from the main level (connected to the range extender) to the basement, the phone would automatically switch connection to the router. When I returned upstairs, the phone would remain connected to the router which was not strong enough strength to do anything so I would have to go to wifi settings on the phone & manually select it for the range extender. Not a big deal unless you travel to the basement like I do probably 20 times daily.I stumbled on something discussing the Eero system and then read many reviews on them and other whole house wifi systems. I decided to purchase a three Eero pack. It was super easy to install, it has been over three months and I have not had to reboot one time, and because my phone sees it as one wifi connection, I can now travel throughout the house with strong signal strength and internet speed.I have one in the basement, one on the main level, and the third one connected to an older TiVo that does not have wireless connection - connected to the Eero ethernet port.For me, it proved to be the end of frustration  of a system that just wasn't working well.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RD9N5FV81B4MR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2J8G951PU68LR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Y. Leventhal",15-Feb-2017,5,"A happy customer-Instant gain of 2x of the wifi speed upon eero installation","Got the eero's this afternoon. It took me no time to set up. Unplugged my Apple Time Machine, plugged in one of the eeros, started up the eero app on my phone--viola! Everything started to work. I tested the wireless speed at various places in the house before and after eeros: In most of the areas the speed increased 2x, just like that! In a couple of &#34;dead&#34; zones, the speed went up 3x (to where the speed was right by the Time Machine). Like one reviewer said, the laws of physics still apply: In the farthest corner of the house (including one of the &#34;dead&#34; zones), the speed is only ½ of the speed in the other areas of the house, but totally usable now (unlike before eero). My Apple TV used to be connected by a cable (the wifi was too slow). I connected the Apple TV via the wireless just to see if that works--the connection was FAST.One eero is in a room separated from the rest of the house by a set of heavy duty sliding glass doors. The other one is about 30+ feet away, equal distance from one end of the house to the other (where the other eero is). I am pretty certain 2 eeros are sufficient, but if not, I can add another one.It took me a while to make up my mind to ditch the Apple router and extenders. I loved my Apple products, but the wifi just never fast enough even for basic web browser. I switched the network from hidden to not hidden, added extenders, tweaked the modem settings (to the extent I could find instructions), nothing helped. I paid extra for faster speed--didn't make a dent. Before buying the eeros, I agonized over what to do with my 3-year old Apple Time Machine. Well, once I saw how fast the wifi was with eeros, no more worries. I will still use the Time Machine for backup, but that's it.I am not sure what makes the wifi gain 2x the speed with eeros (am not referring to the &#34;mesh&#34; effect either), but the speed gain plus the mesh (aka blanketing) effect really makes a difference with tricky situations. So far I am very very happy.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GRY286EQN0TH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2UVJIJ26VR8AY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

I also bought the 3-Eero pack and a new modem at the same time.  I don't know how much of the improvement to internet speed over wifi that I've enjoyed since installing both can be credited to Eero versus the new modem or the combination of the two, but we do seem to have far better speed and coverage throughout our house.  We do not pay for business-class service through our cable provider, just a slightly upgraded conventional service, but before installing Eero, my internet connection in my office upstairs was slow as molasses -- online speed tests showed download speeds of anywhere from 2 to 6 Mbps, and now I'm consistently around 50 Mbps, according to the Eero app.  We've had only the occasional hiccup with streaming music or video entertainment with the new setup, most of which we do in the upstairs areas of our house.  My only gripe, and it's no fault of the Eero, is that I had to reinstall all three of our Nest smoke detectors after setup, which required pulling them out of the ceiling and resetting them all.

I've been using the system for about a month now and I'm quite satisfied with the product. Setup was a breeze and took only a few minutes. One of the units was defective, and died shortly after setup. Upon calling support, I was delighted to have the phone answered on the second ring by a real human being who was knowledgeable, and spoke English. He immediately had a new unit shipped out. While waiting for its arrival, I set up with the remaining two units, and found they were adequate to cover my entire 4,500 square foot house! Now, with three units going, I have great coverage in every nook and cranny, and the signal has not dropped once. It works flawlessly, and invisibly. I dropped one star only because the bottoms of the units seem to run warm, although thus far  it hasn't  affected performance.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YP6LXXD3L2VG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A27FSWG0F19GN3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Amazon Customer",11-Feb-2017,5,"I was skeptical, but I am SO happy I bought this!","Our house was the dreaded dead zone. The modem/router was in the room directly above our living room, yet we would still have trouble keeping a wifi connection on the smart tv in the living room. I was so angry, paying for the highest internet speed but dropping connections all the time! We had tried 3 different internet companies, and a wifi extender, plus we tried two different modems on our current internet provider...to no avail. I was convinced that I would forever have to deal with buffering and rebooting devices. A few weeks back I googled &#34;how to get rid of dead wifi zones&#34; and several articles about &#34;mesh&#34; wifi came up...then it dawned on me that my company has mesh wifi for our building of 12,000 people, so I know it works! I saw this company had good reviews, and a lot of the happy customers had had all of the same experiences I did, which were fixed by Eero.Oh. My. God. I wish I had this years ago! Installation was really easy, and as soon as the devices were hooked up I was running around the house streaming YouTube/Netflix/Amazon Fire Stick on every tv, and every computer simultaneously...No buffering on anything! I have not had any connection problems since that day.I was sent a new modem by Spectrum today (since they bought time warner) and I did have trouble reconfiguring the eero with the new modem. However, after spending 3 hours on the phone with Spectrum I gave up and called Eero, and they were able to walk me through every step. They did a lot of the work remotely on their side, updating the network and explaining the reason the new modem didn't automatically recognize the device. I was good to go, and now everything works brilliantly with the new modem.

Worse, one of the three just died 4 days after the return window, Eero said they can't help with a return. I'm really frustrated.The first issue is Netflix wouldn't connect through it. I spent about 4 hours trying to diagnose it setting things up in different ways, calling Samsung (who makes the BluRay) and Netflix. Then spending an hour with Eero support only to conclude it couldn't be fixed. (It doesn't work with a Sony BluRay I have either.) I bought two more, newer Samsung BluRays, but they didn't work either. I returned those and got a Google Chromecast, which does work great. It's a first world problem, as is the fact that I now need two devices to watch Netflix or BluRays, but better wifi is what I paid for, right?Another odd issue that may or may not be related is that apps won't download on our iPhones or iPad anymore, they hang up partway through the download, I have to connect to my phone carrier and download them from there, which works fine.At this point, I've spent over 15 hours trying to get Eero working right. I'm tired. I want to send it back. But I can't return it because the third unit died 2/8, the return window closed 1/31. So I just burned $400. You might try Google's equivalent product instead.

The house was built in the early part of the 1800's. the walls on this house are 12&#34; thick and solid concrete and brick. I was very concerned that I was going to struggle to get wifi signal properly dispersed into all the rooms of the building.I put the first AP on the main floor. The other two are upstairs in different offices. I did a thorough site survey and am getting very strong signal in every room and around the outside perimeter of the building. This was true even with our mobile devices.The initial installation was remarkably simple to on my iPhone 7 using the EERO app. One of the valuable &#34;extra&#34; features of this system are the duavailable Ethernet ports on the back of each device. My office manager uses a tower-style PC. It has no wireless capability. His office has no hardwired Ethernet ports in it. We were able to put one of the EERO devices in his office and run an Ethernet cable from the device over to his PC. He gets excellent connectivity and function.I am very particular about my tech and expect it to perform as best as is possible.

Long story short, if you have a network that requires any degree of sophistication, GWF isn't really the answer.  Enter Eero that has a bridge mode that allows you keep your existing network architecture if you need it. Installation was supposed to be plug and play but it failed on a firmware update.  While customer support was very responsive and friendly, I basically had to find my own way to update the firmware on one recalcitrant unit.

"Entrope",08-Feb-2017,5,"Excellent streaming ability, even with multiple 1080p cameras","Feb 8, 2017 update:They just released the 2.2.0 firmware update yesterday.  It is supposed to have fixed delays in switching access points when roaming, down to something like 50ms, among other things.  This problem affected people using WiFi calling on Apple devices, where the call might drop if moving about.  Also, I did notice streaming apps would lose connection when the connection dropped.  It does appear to be better, but have yet to extensively test, but support page feedback looks very positive.  They do update firmware every month or two, and actively post on their community and reddit pages.  One positive I want to mention is that streaming performance outside, where I used to have serious issues by the pool, appears to be much better now than with my old (but recent) Apple router, even though the main node is placed in the same room as before (and is closest to the pool).  Looking forward to seeing how well this works this summer.  So while there are cheaper options out there, this does have very good customer support and a much more mature product than something like the Google WiFi.  Also noticed that Wifi signal is unaffected while a microwave oven is on--I was able to stream on my phone while sitting right next to it, which is a pleasant surprise.  One more thing.  Be wary of critical reviews containing outdated info, especially the featured ones here.  Firmware updates move quickly (for the networking space), so you should really go to the Eero community support or reddit pages to get the most current feedback so you don't pass over the product due to negative reviewers who won't update/remove their reviews because they'll lose their up votes.Original:This replaced an Airport Extreme and 2 Airport Express extenders. One issue with the old setup is that when moving around the house, devices would stay locked with degraded unusable connections for too long and not switch. Another is that I needed to get streaming to work flawlessly because I am planning to add multiple Nest Cam Outdoor Security Camera 2 pack. Once I added a Skybell HD I could see issues because that device gets bogged down an unreliable without a very robust WiFi signal. While moving the Express around helped, I could still see the signal strength fluctuate even when connected to it, just located on the other side of the wall. Also, with one Nest cam streaming continuously, there would be hiccups with that stream when the Skybell was also recording. All these issues seem to have disappeared since installing the Eeros, and now I've ordered another two Nest cams and upgraded the Skybell to use full 1080 video instead of degraded 480 or 720 options.Installation was very very easy. I mean not a single issue with the Eeros themselves, but I did disable/enable Wifi on two Macs and reboot of a Slingbox 500. I appreciated that they allow you to do configure some advanced networking features, and while there does not appear to be user configurable QoS yet, their web page says there is a basic implementation in place, and that they may offer more capabilities.Even if you don't buy this mesh networking product, most people would be better off with one over a traditional router because these vendors are actively competing on features and performance with aggressive firmware updates, and the only thing a tradition router will get is a once in a blue moon security update. On that note, I would discourage people from an Orbi, since that appears to be a gussied up Netgear with the latest specs. Once you take a look at the browser configuration interface, it will be very familiar to anyone who has had a Netgear router, devoid of any imagination or cutting edge features or modern interface. No useful info about clients offered. At least for the Eero, I could not find a single review claiming the routers needed periodic rebooting, as we are all accustomed to, even with the Apple products (though better than Dlink or Netgear routers).Eero is the one recommended by Leo Laporte, as I saw on his feed, though since Eero is a sponsor, objectivity could be compromised. I was seriously thinking about the Amplifi since the router itself is uber cool, but I had issues with the very large satellites and their orientation, as well as a number of reviews suggesting things like poor performance or quality control issues. One thing that sold me about the Eero is their claim that their implementation performs active routing, as you will see on the blog post explaining the TrueMesh technology. So if one node is busy, it can reroute traffic to another, which makes these satellites behave more like routers actually employing an active routing protocol. From speaking with Amplifi tech support, I was not convinced that the roaming functionality would work seamlessly, but I can't speak from first hand experience. While I might buy and try still, so far I'm content with the Eeros.Let me say that some of the earlier reviews, say pre-Nov 17 2016, do not have the benefit of using the 2.x firmware. I fully expect many reviews addressing performance as a concern are out of date since they don't reflect current reality. My unit shipped with 1.2 firmware, and once I updated to 2.1, the WAN throughput doubled from 55Mbps to 110Mbps, my ISP limit. I may pay another $10 per month to upgrade my ISP speed once I get enough Nest cams to tax my upper limit (11Mbps) on the upload. From the Nest webpage, each cam at 1080p uses 450 Kbps (0.45 Mbps) upload on average, and 1.2Mbps max, so really I should be well under the ISP max with a number of camera streaming. The 802.11ac protocol, used by the Eeros, supports 1.3 Gbps, or 1331 Mbps, so for anyone curious, the protocol between the Eeros should have more than ample room to support numerous 1080 streams, plus a 4K stream with ease.Upgrading firmware was easy--I just pushed the option in the IOS app to upgrade, and it proceeded to upgrade all three devices. Even those with recent purchases may not have taken the initiative to update the firmware, so that is something to consider when reading reviews since most people don't report what they are using.I did seriously consider the Google Wifi, but was concerned about the immaturity and lack of any advanced features. It might work for average users, but for instance, from what I read you cannot even specify a preferred subnet. While perhaps that might change with future updates, with the Eero you get a maturing product, versus a very new Google product. The one concern I have with Eero is the high price.  I guess you would want to buy this if you want superior customer support with a lot of attention placed on advancing the product's capabilities.  And probably because it is, at this point, more mature than a number of recent offerings.One thing that bothered me before purchasing was the lack of line of sight that they recommend. My primary router is in a corner room, and not central in the house, and invariably goes through drywall covered walls. I was researching Power over Ethernet to use a a backhaul to the Eero satellites, but decided to setup and test without POE. So far, I can say I don't see a reason I will ever need to use POE with these existing two satellites. One issue with what I found on POE products offered on amazon is that I would be worried about periodic rebooting and troubleshooting of those devices. So my advice for anyone similarly concerned about line of sight is to try it naked first and figure out a way to place within rooms that minimizes obstructions. Obviously, anyone with Cat 6 interior cabling already installed would want to use that.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RY7EYJB9S4AU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3AR7AKM2MFO0S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"gregf1082",06-Feb-2017,5,"I am very happy with EERO!","I purchased  3 pack several weeks ago to replace an old set of routers I had at my previous house.  I moved to a 2000 square foot ranch house that is spread out more than my old house. The old routers and extenders were not handling everything thoughout the house and yard.  When I moved I purchased a 75MB service.  The best service I could get from the old routers inside the house was 29MB.  After hearing about EERO on the podcast IOS Today I started reading the reviews for the EERO over several weeks I finally decided to purchase the 3 pack.  It was amazing how easy it  was to install the three units.  I did not have any probems getting them up and running. The modem is down in the basement so the first EERO is down there next to the modem.. The next one is on the main level in the middle of the house to the front of the house in the office.  The third one is about 30 feet away from the one in the basement but on the main level on the back side of the house.  Coverage is fantastic inside the house, the garage  and out in the front yard and back yard!  I now receive the 75MB that I am paying for and have great coverage everywhere!  I like the idea that the system will be updated automatically.  Everyone in the family is happy that we have made the move to EERO!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RA1BMMC0IMR4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2ZPA2GWSU8OS7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

My experience has been bad with lots of dropped wireless connections.  When using a mobile device such as an iPhone, it will occasionally drop wireless for a second or two.  This is with me being about 20ft from the router and not moving.  It can do this several times in a 15 to 20 minute window.  I have contacted their Tech support a couple of times, and all they say is reboot the eero and you phone.  I didn't pay this kind of money for a router that I have to constantly reboot.  I even tried running with just one Eero and had the same results.Their mobile app is nice, but their gateway hardware or software (don't know which) is crap.

"Joe Johnson",03-Feb-2017,2,"Meh, not great depending on how you use it","While I never dropped wifi completely, as promised in their marketing stuff, the problem with not dropping is how poor performance can get before it does drop.

I'd watch my signal meter in the MacBook change from high to low and back like a yo-yo at all times. On the nice side, I had basic connectivity all the way into the elevator in my building, a good 50 meters from the AP, but often I had no signal from across the unobstructed room.Pros:-Signal never dropped, like ever. Would work 50M away through walls and concrete with (limited) connectivity-Able to use Facebook and Skype and other basic services without issue-Streamed video up to 1080P on my Amazon Fire TV which was 1-2 feet awayCons:-Sometimes at close range I would have unusable wifi, connected but so choppy it was useless-Video at 1080P was rare, often the best I could get was 2-3Mbps 720P on Fire TV-Text services were good but media services suffered big time","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JQ42V7JPBHR9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3MVMHW3R5MGHB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

Power on second unit about 30' away from first unit. Second unit refused to admit that it was close enough to the first unit to function at about 30' away.  Setup refuses to continue until it is close enough.3. Move second unit to 20' away, setup still says it's too far away.4. Move second unit to 10' away, setup still says it's too far away.5. Move second unit to 1' away, setup still says it's too far away.6. Return to main menu; alert tells me system needs an update; attempt update; update fails after 15 minutes.7. Attempt update again; update succeeds on first unit but fails on second unit.8. Check if updated first device fixed distance issue.  Nope.9. Consult Google.10. Hard wire second device to first device.  Ok, now it's close enough.  But when I unplug it, it's no longer close enough.11. Hard reset everything and start over.12. Connect first unit to modem.13. Hard wire second device to first device and complete addition to network.14. Hard wire third device via switch (since first device only has two ethernet ports) and complete addition to network.15. While everything is still wired together, install all updates.16. Unplug and distribute units, which now seem to think that a little distance is fine.Total installation time: 5-6 hours.Required equipment: another router or switch to temporarily create a network that all 3 units can be hardwired into, and so that you can continue to have internet to Google the solutions to all of this nonsense.Conclusion: set-up process needs SERIOUS WORK.Now that it's actually working, so far it appears to be working fine.

"ACR",02-Feb-2017,1,"EERO has alot of room for improvement.  Unfortunately, recent firmware upgrades have degraded bandwidth severely.","I have a network that consists of 9 EERO access points.  I purchased the first 6 before the company was even producing the product and became a beta tester.  Initially I was very pleased with the wifi coverage and bandwidth that was usually in the range of 20-45Mbps down and 90Mbps upload as measured by the EERO app.  My house is older and constructed with cement (cinder) blocks.  Previous to the eero it was nearly impossible to obtain wifi coverage from one end of the house to the other.  I used wifi repeaters, boosters, high gain antennas,  etc.  The house is single story.  Recently, EERO uploaded firmware upgrades (OS v2.2.0-2478) to all of my units and the entire network has fallen apart.  My download speed has dropped to  3-13 Mbps with upload speeds remaining in the 90Mbps range.  This is measured using eero's own app that supposedly measures the bandwidth at the gateway EERO.  I have measured the bandwidth with my laptop and desktop plugged into the same router and they consistently will measure download speeds of 93-96Mbps and upload speeds of 97-99Mbps as measured by Ookla speedtest.  I have emailed customer support on numerous occasions.  I have sent customer support a floorplan with the layout of the EERO mesh network including distances between the various eero access points.  I have moved the access points closer together, rebooted and implemented recommended &#34;fixes&#34;.  What is particularly concerning is the fact only 3 of the 9 units have a signal that is considered good and the other 6 consistently have a signal that is rated poor by the EERO app.  This was not the case until this firmware upgrade.  I have asked for some answers but have not received any.  I guess it is time to chunk EERO and give Netgear's ORBI or Linksys Velop a try.  I will update this review if the mesh network starts to work as designed.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BFAIRWCU4DRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3H9GDGMJEQ8QW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Mal JD",31-Jan-2017,5,"Solved the weak wi-fi signal in 1920s home","I live with my family of four in a two storey 1800 square foot house built in the 1920s. The house is not open plan and the walls are mostly lath and plaster. Typically we have a dozen or more devices competing for bandwidth. I had been “surviving” on the modem/router (gateway) supplied by Comcast, but the wi-fi signal to most parts of my house was weak at best. In the living room it was often less than one Mbps. In the upstairs bedrooms it was frequently less than five Mbps.Before spending significant dollars on an Eero or Google wifi product, I purchased a new modem and new router, the latter a Linksys WRT1900ACS (I’ve since returned it). While it received good reviews for range, it made only marginal improvement in my home. In the living room where I plan to put a smart TV, it was still averaging under 10Mbps. So I decided to spring for one of the new mesh systems. I would have purchased Google wifi based upon the reviews, but they are out of stock everywhere.So I decided to go with Eero. I purchased the three pack, even though that would seem overkill based upon what I read. I managed to get one Eero in one of the upstairs bedrooms, in line of sight (when doors aren’t closed) with the base Eero in the home office. Now the upstairs bedrooms get 100Mbps much of the time, but certainly above 75Mbps. Problem solved. The third Eero I put in the kitchen two rooms over from the living room. To my slight surprise, the Chromecast on my current TV connected to the Eero in the bedroom, directly above it. The living room now gets greater than 75 Mbps most of the time. Back in the kitchen and the adjoining dining room, I’m also getting in excess of 75Mbps. The back yard also benefits from the third Eero. Problem solved.I may still try Google wifi, if I can get my hands on it before my return period ends with Amazon for the Eero, but if not, at least I can now enjoy awesome wi-fi coverage, even if it did cost me a few bucks more. As for the Eero - the set up was a breeze. My Sonos plugged in to the kitchen Eero worked first time, and the Eero app has worked flawlessly. The only slight disappointment, apart from the price, is not having the option to not broadcast the SSID. Perhaps that capability will come in one of their frequent updates. Also, I can’t see what devices are connected to a particular Eero, by selecting that Eero in the app. Instead I have to go to each device separately to see which Eero it is connected to.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RC09XG5URI9HU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1Y8N13JD8MEWV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Byron Antillon",29-Jan-2017,2,"I was getting better speeds on my older Apple airport extreme","I placed one of the three eero's in my office and the speeds there are slow. I pay for a 300Mbps x 20Mbps connection and I'm seeing 42Mbps in my office (~10' away from the eero which is directly connected to my cable modem).  Perhaps I'm too close to the eero but I can't force my PC to connect to a further eero. In any case for the price I paid for this device I should see much faster speeds that 42Mbps. I was getting better speeds on my older Apple airport extreme. That said the interface on the app and the setup were quite simple, I really like the family profiles and based on that I rate this product a 2. But seriously $500 hardware to get such slow speeds is ridiculous.  Performance on the other two devices fluctuates greatly depending a several variables, so overall I'm not happy. I would probably try similar technology offered by several other competitors (Google On-Hub, Linksys Velop or Neatgear's Orbi) all in similar price points and Linksys does offer their tri-band technology which sounds promising! Do your research before you commit to eero.  They may have been first to market, but the competition is steep and getting better.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VWRT1X7ZXI2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1LV5BBLC9VSNY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Maui",28-Jan-2017,2,"FiOS/Sonos/AppleTV incompatibility – sending eero back","Lengthy note follows so I have divided it into 3 sections if you want to skip ahead: (1) the problems I had (1 star); (2) experience with eero Customer Support (4 stars); and (3) implications for other potential buyersThe ProblemsI don’t think I have anything unusually complicated but it is also not a simple set-up.  I have Verizon FiOS, which means we have a single unit for the modem/router.  This also, per the eero website, creates a distinctive wireless environment where the FiOS wireless network shouldn’t be turned off once eero is up and running.  Connected to the wifi network is a collection of devices – computers, cell phones, tablets; some smart thermostats (Nest and Ecobee) and, unfortunately for eero, two Sonos AMP boxes to play music in a couple of our rooms and an AppleTV device.I found the installation process initially stressful but ultimately straightforward and simple.  The initial stress was because after reading about the potential challenges with FiOS I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to figure out how to make it work.  Eero recommended putting the eero in “Bridge” mode and this differs from the step by step instructions they have available so I was concerned I would lose my way in the install.  However, it is very easy, which is what eero told me it would be.  It took about 15 minutes to get the three eero devices connected and functioning, and the mobile eero app was very easy to use.  After I got the eero’s up and running connecting the other devices to the eero network was also straightforward – nothing different than connecting to any other wifi network.  All the computers, iPads, thermostats etc. all found the network and connected without any apparent problems.  Importantly, the eero signal was strong throughout the house, which was the major issue I was trying to solve.However, it was a different story with Sonos and AppleTV. Mysteriously, one of the Sonos boxes would drop out of the eero network after initially being found, and one of the Sonos boxes worked perfectly.  If I rebooted the faulty Sonos box, right after the reset I would see it on the eero network but as soon as I tried to play music, it would drop off.  The AppleTV was similarly mysteriously faulty. I like to use the AppleTV to play music on our home sound system and the music is located on my iPhone.  Prior to eero, this was easy to do – AppleTV recognized my iPhone and the music (and other content) on the phone and would play it.  However, with eero, AppleTV didn’t find the phone.  Oddly, I can use my iPhone in “Airplay” mode to still play music via AppleTV.  In other words I could “push” music from my iPhone to AppleTV but I couldn’t “pull” music using AppleTV from the iPhone.  Figure that one out!Customer Service ExperienceThis experience was positive, despite neither of the problems being solved.  I used email exchanges to communicate with the eero folks – I wanted to make sure they had time to figure out my problem and suggest an appropriate fix and I wanted to be able to try the fix on my own time.  Eero would respond in hours to my emails and their responses were friendly, easy to read and understand and they were not condescending to me, given my lack of technical aptitude.  Alos, every email from eero includes the phone number and hours of operation in case I wanted to call and speak with someone live – how many times have we been to help websites and been unable to find a phone number!  I want to thank Raoul, Isaac, and Hayden for helping try to solve the problems.  However, nothing worked so I am going to pull out the eero network and send it back.Implications for othersReflecting on this situation, I think there are some generalizations to think about if you are considering purchasing eero.  The first is that everyone’s wifi situation is going to be unique and I am sure others are successfully using Sonos and AppleTV with eero. So my problems are mine, and may not be yours.  Second, eero won’t work in all instances.  There is obviously something going on between the eero network and some systems that reside on it.  This is important to think about because I would have thought the eero network was “dumb” – it would capture a wifi signal from a device and pass it on its way without any modification.  However, eero appears to be doing something to the information it picks up – it is trying to be “smart” - and this is where problems will arise.  As I dug deeper into the help section and the eero community blogs I found many instances where eero was interacting in odd ways with devices on the network.  Often the problem would be solved.  There were a number of instances where people had posted that after an eero software update what had been working stopped working.  This needs to be considered as well – because of the way eero has designed its system, it might make a change in the future (or someone like Sonos or Apple might make a change) and your system will go down again.  This is ultimately why I told eero to stop working on my problem – I decided that even if they fixed it (which is a big if) I didn’t want to run the risk that I would have to go through this all over again the next time they released an update.My brother is an engineer at Cisco (how is that for supposedly having an unfair advantage!) and he recommended I try an “access point” since I have Ethernet cable throughout my house. He recommended: TP-Link TL-WA901ND Wireless N450 3TER Access Point, 2.4Ghz 450Mbps, 802.11b/g/n, AP/Client/Bridge/Repeater, 3x 5dBi, Passive POE.  I am going to give these a try but reading the product name makes me nervous – I have no idea what any of this means!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CCQCWKC3H3WG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1FW7CHMD950HD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Troy W.",26-Jan-2017,5,"Premium product (and worth it)","Beautifully simple and effective. I'll admit the price tag gave me pause initially, but I was desperate for a solution to inconsistent WiFi throughout my home and constantly buffering Netflix and Hulu. We don't have cable, so streaming quality is important to us. The system came highly recommended by a friend who had similar issues, so I gave it a try. I had tried various routers and range extenders (wired and wireless) in the past, none of which seemed to work as advertised.First, and most importantly, the system works. It created a single, continuous network throughout my home. I don't have to switch networks when I'm on the patio or upstairs and my online and streaming experience is now what I expect it to be. We have phones, tablets, computers, printers, Sonos, Roku, etc. all connected to a single network and it works awesome.The packaging was clean and elegant. The setup could not have been more simple. The iPhone app is incredible. It allows me to monitor the network, see which devices are connected, test download and upload speeds, turn on/off guest access, and more.After several weeks, one of the units wasn't connecting to the network, so I called their support number. It was late on a Sunday evening and I was connected with a polite, English-speaking representative. He tried a few things and in a matter of minutes decided to express ship a new replacement unit instead of keeping me on the line. It was easily one of the best call center experiences I've had.Absolutely no buyer's remorse here.

"Matt",26-Jan-2017,5,"As good as advertised!","I live in a condo complex where my unit has 3 levels, lots of walls and stairs, and about 25 other wireless signals from neighbors. Traditional wifi setup (of a modem/router combo unit on the first floor and a range extender on the second level) just wasn't working. And believe me, I have tried and tried. After years of frustration and spotty signal strength from other products, I decided to go top of the line and order eero (3 pack). Finally, my problems are solved.About 15 minutes after opening the box, eero was updated and broadcasting. I've never had a problem since. My ISP (Comcast unfortunately) provides 75Mbps; every speed test I've run with eero indicates 80+. The handoff of devices from one router to the next is equally impressive. The real kicker is the wall to wall coverage though; signal strength is routinely double that (160+), when before that I felt lucky to get 10.I've used many devices at once; a wired computer, wired DVR, wireless DVR, wireless laptop, two iPads, three smart phones. None of them have ever lost a signal.Expensive yes, but so worth it.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2V7JZAMLXEDCU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1DZE4Y3Q0YMK7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"Dee Sooner",26-Jan-2017,3,"Only modest improvement with one Eero","I have a 932 sq foot home with only one person using, so I purchased a single Eero, per the recommendation on Eero's website and reviews on Amazon.  My internet speed increase and reliability has been, in a word, &#34;meh.&#34;  My Eero speed tests consistently report at least 5-8Mbps faster than my three other third-party tests report (Simple Speed, SpeedSpot, AT&T speed test), so I'm not sure what is true.  I have the following devices connected: Macbook, iPhone, Ring doorbell, Sonos, HP printer, Roku.  I have CenturyLink 20Mbps download internet access, which is probably average for people in my income range, neighborhood and usage.  I'm not sure a modest performance improvement was worth $200; while I haven't tested it, I may achieve just as much or more improvement upgrading to CenturyLink 40Mbps download.  I'm sure it is a fantastic device if one has a 2,000+ sq ft home with 2 stories and uses 2-3 Eeros; I have friends who love it.  But I have not experienced a material improvement for a smallish one-story home.In researching the Eero website, blog and support board, even a single Eero is claimed to outperform a home router, though Eero is certainly designed to work best as a system. Performance includes more than just speed - also includes buffering, reliability and reach. Overall, I saw only a small increase in overall performance of my home network with one Eero. Bottom line: if you have a home &#60;1,000 sq feet, a cord-cutter who streams everything, and have only modest disposable income, you are not Eero's target market. Frankly, I'm not sure why Eero even encourages anyone to purchase just one Eero, as clearly it works best as a system of at least 2-3 Eeros to reach all areas of a bigger home. It is disappointing that Eero's customer support is blaming the customer - me - for my simply not understanding.  I will be returning.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SYN3YGFPK4PG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2HMG7E6K6KPYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

In the end they were returned for a refund.I have a large house (5000 sq ft over 2 floors) with a second pool house (1000 sq ft).  I have ethernet to may rooms so I wanted a system that used ethernet to communicate instead of WiFi and eero seemed like the perfect choice.  Set-up was simple using the app and adding the IP reservations and ports to forward was also simple.  The problem was that the eeros simply would not work as expected and kept dropping connections and, when they would connect, the speed was about 3 Mbps (I get ~120 Mbps from Comcast and via ethernet .  Tech support said it was most likely due to interference (both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands) and that all 6 of my eeros were 'thermal cycling' (slowing the speed to cool off when they got too hot).  I bought an Rf frequency monitor and verified there was no Rf interference on the 5 GHz band unless I was actively using the WiFi connection via a local eero.  They may work well for some, but they did not work for me.  I bought option #2 after returning the eeros (AmpliFi HD) and they have been working well for the last week or so (100+ Mbps via WiFi and no drop outs).  I don't think it was environmental interference that caused issues with the eeros given how well the AmpliFi's work.  I hope eero can solve the issues (or maybe my house is unique, but I doubt it).I was happy with the eero tech support.

The NPR reporter mentioned the eero as her ideal wish list item.  After a bit of research and understanding how eero technology is much more effective at extending wi-fi versus traditional extenders, I decided to purchase the eero two-pack for our two-story, 1,900 sqft home.  The result:  we now get steady wi-fi in our second story back office versus before we had a netgear extender which could not reach the office.  After a month of enjoying the two-pack eero, we got greedy and purchased a third eero unit to amp up wi-fi speed in the upstairs office.  The third unit is the cherry and we are super happy with being able to use our upstairs office instead of camping out in the living room close to the router.ALSO a side note - when deactivating the router function in our internet service provider's modem and activating the eero router function, I reached out to Spectrum/Time Warner for help. Big kudos to Spectrum/Time Warner for already having knowledge on how to redirect the router from the Spectrum modem to the eero device.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34WWPGVR6JUQH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3ZTQHJEBZAJ9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

As well, the range for each module is very impressive.  We can easily go 100 ft in any direction and have excellent signal.My one favorite feature about the EERO system compared to several other similar systems I was looking at, is that each module has two ethernet ports on that back that allow two things to be available: 1) I can hardwire devices at my office(that do not have wifi option) to these via ethernet cable, and 2) I can hardwire the modules via ethernet back to the main unit serving as the router which provides a more robust setup with a much less chance of dropouts.I will definitely recommend these to other for their small offices and homes.

The third one we place downstairs in the downstairs elbow connected wirelessly. This fixed our weak zone in the front, however our performance in the back yard has been disminished.

"Mike S",15-Jan-2017,2,"Good idea, performance issues, could be bad for gaming","---- Edit 2/20/2017 ----I will say eero Customer Service has been awesome.  But, after two replacement eeros I am still  having problems as outlined below.  I am at the point, I have disconnected the closest node to my laptop so I only connect to the gateway node to minimize drops.  I still have drops on the gateway node (via ping test described below) but not as frequent, though they seem to occur at bad times (e.g., watching a vid or playing a game).  Not sure what to do next.Also, today, I have and issue where the eero iPhone app displays that there is a internet connectivity issue and the Gateway eero is offline.  YET, I can still connect to the internet through the laptop and other devices [scratches head].  CS told me to reboot the eeros AGAIN to see if it fixes the problem  At this point, I am afraid to touch anything when things are working so I told them I would wait till there is a problem (I run a significant internet based home business) or I can afford to be down.I am still hoping things get worked out and stabilized a little more, but will probably picking up a backup router just in case. I will update this review again as things progress.----- Original Review ----Be careful if you game or periodic dropped connections will cause problems.  I have 3 of these and all of them are on one floor within 50' of each other.  After installing, I started constantly seeing internet lag and dropped connections.  My son, playing games, kept getting booted out of games because of the dropped connections.So, I decided to do a little Ping test.  The eero that was connected to the cable modem was x.x.x.1, and the eero that was in the family room was x.x.x.27.  My laptop was wireless connected to x.x.x.27.  By nature of the mesh network, my laptop path to the internet should simplistically be:Laptop ==&#62; x.x.x.27 ==&#62; x.x.x.1 ==&#62; Cable Modem ==&#62; InternetTo monitor the connection I opened a 3 DOS Command windows, with each window running one of the following ping commands:1) ping -t x.x.x.12) ping -t x.x.x.273) ping -t 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS Server [internet])The -t option keeps the ping test running constantly so I could monitor the connections.  It turns out the ping to x.x.x.27 stayed pretty steady, while the ping to x.x.x.1 kept timing out.  This led me to believe that the connectivity between x.x.x.27 and x.x.x.1 was the problem.  So I disconnected power from x.x.x.27 which forced my laptop to connecto to x.x.x.1... GUESS WHAT?The problem went away!I plugged the family room eero back in and the problem returned.  I switched eeros with the third (by the entry way) and the problem still existed.  I factory reset the eero and re-added back to the network and the problem still exists.So this leads me to believe there is a problem with their mesh implementation and/or possible interference rejection between the nodes.I NEVER had a dropped connection with my previous Linksys router. The only reason I replaced it was because I dropped it while rearranging the office and broke off the anntennae. I have some pretty good experience working with secure mesh networks and understand the benefits so I thought  I would give this commercial technology a try......IMHO, they will get there, but there is still several bugs and performance issues to be worked out.Note:Hopefully I explained the above simply enough for others to try the test and see what performance you are getting.  You can find the IP addresses to use in the eero app by clicking on nodes at the bottom of the My Network page.  Click the number next to Number of Devices on that page to get a list of all the devices connected to the network, look for the computer you are running the ping test on to see what eero your compter is connected to.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3449TY1FLFQUV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3RHV1Q2CIIIPR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Maggie Keegan Gross",14-Jan-2017,3,"It makes me sad to have to post such a mediocre review - ...","It makes me sad to have to post such a mediocre review - there are a lot of things Eero does well, and I really wanted to keep this product, but in the end it didn't work for my situation. In short, I just switched from Uverse to Spectrum, and as part of the change, I bought my own modem, the Arris Surfboard SB6183 (https://www.amazon.com/ARRIS-SURFboard-SB6183-DOCSIS-Cable/dp/B00MA5U1FW) based on the recommended supported modems from Spectrum and the excellent reviews on the Surfboard. Cable guy came and set me up, the modem worked perfectly and I was pulling down 117 mb/s on ethernet.I opened up the Eero and set up the primary -- set up was a piece of cake, you just download the app on your phone and follow the instructions. It was working within a couple minutes, and I was getting full speed over wifi standing right in front of the primary. I tested the speeds around our place (we have 1 level, 3 bedrooms) - in the furthest bedroom from the primary Eero I was getting about 33 mb/s. Not bad, considering that it was a deadzone with my previous setup. I plugged in the 2nd Eero in the hallway outside the furthest bedroom, and it found the primary and set up without a problem. Afterwards, I was getting about 77 mb/s down in that far bedroom. Pretty good!So I was happy, I moved all our wifi devices onto the network and figured I had solved internet in our place once and for all.Well, the next day I bought a new phone (big holiday week for tech!). I brought my phone home and restored from my computer backup and started downloading all my apps from the Apple app store. Only... some of them weren't downloading. I figured it was some kind of bottleneck due to the large number of apps I was downloading at the same time, and let it go for the evening. The next morning, about half of my apps were done, and the other half were just missing. Hmm. So I jumped onto the App Store and started downloading the missing apps one by one. And here's when I noticed the problem. Some of them downloaded without a problem, but some of them just would not finish! It would start, get about 30%, or 50%, or 75% done downloading, and then I would get a dialog that said &#34;This app cannot be downloaded at this time. Retry/Cancel?&#34; And I would retry, and it would start downloading, and I would get the same dialog. Over and over. Now, the part that made it really frustrating was that sometimes.. if you persisted long enough.. it would actually finish. And so I spent the next 3 days, tip tapping away at this dialog, retry, retry, retry, hoping to finish all my app downloads.Was it the new ISP? Was it the new modem? Was it the new Eero? Was it the App Store? Unfortunately I had so many variables, I wasn't sure where to start or who to call first. So I tried another network. I turned off Wifi and tried downloading the trouble apps on LTE - and they downloaded instantly. Ok - so it was network.I jumped on my computer, also connected to the network, and tried downloading some apps directly from iTunes. Similar situation -- apps would start downloading, and then I would get &#34;Error 3253&#34;, which is a generic &#34;download interrupted, check your network connection&#34; type error.So it was the network, and it was specifically the Apple stores that I was having a problem with. No issues with any other source of content - Netflix, Hulu, all my streaming media was working just fine. I spent a lot of time googling the issue, and couldn't find anything specifically resembling my symptoms - I did see that there were some reported problems between the Arris SB6183 modem and the Eeros, when the Arris had a specific version of firmware. However, my Arris did not have that firmware version. My Arris is on D30CM-OSPREY-1.5.2.3-GA-01-NOSH, where the problem firmware was SB6183-9.2.0.0-GA-03-29-NOSH.So next step was to switch out the Eero and then the modem, and see what specifically was causing the issue. I started with the Eero - I bought a new router, the TP-Link Archer C7 (v2) as recommended by Wirecutter. Unplugged Eero, setup of the Archer (which is a hideous black thing with 3 antennas and a real light show of green LEDs that CANNOT  be turned off). Set up was easy, I spun up a wifi network and tried downloading one of the troublesome apps -- and it downloaded with no problem, and very quickly. I tried a few more apps, on my phone and my computer, and everything downloaded quickly without issue. Sigh. So it was the Eeros.I tested the speed of the Archer around my place to see if maybe I wanted to hook up the Eeros in bridge mode alongside the Archer. In the furthest bedroom, where I was getting 77 mb/s before with the Eeros, I was able to get 100 mb/s with the Archer. Wow. I guess those hideous antennas are doing something right. Sigh again. So I didn't need the Eeros at all, our place was small enough (around 1300 sq ft) that the 1 Archer was able to handle the job.So, I packed up the Eeros and sent them back today. As I said, I was very sad to do so -- the Eeros are aesthetically lovely, and the app is too. I hate looking at the Archer, and I need to buy some black tape to cover up the laser show of LEDs. But for whatever reason, the Eeros just weren't working with the largest content provider in my life, and thats a deal breaker.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TG9TY96RSSPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1Q68NL64H7QO1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Mary Ventura",13-Jan-2017,5,"No More Resetting Signal!!!","5 years ago I moved from a 1300 sqft home to a 3300 sqft home. And for 5 years I have struggled to get consistent, high quality coverage throughout our space.I have spent at least $300 in modems, wifi routers and extenders, not to mention hours...sometimes the better part of an entire day setting a network up, only to find equipment isn't compatible and I need to start over.We had made due with one extender that needed to be reset about 3x week.When I heard about Eero I was excited, maybe my evenings of crawling out of bed in the middle of a show to reset the signal were over.They ARE!!! Eero is as amazing as I heard it was!!!I set the whole system (I bought the 3 pack) up in about 30 minutes- that includes time spent reading the instructions.We have a network, a personalized password that makes sense...not the weird random series of characters everyone hates but beginners don't know how to change...(For reference, I don't consider myself a beginner in this work, I am tech savvy and able to work my way through networks and systems, however setting up multiple different extenders on one network proved difficult for me. We had personalized network password before eero).I can control everything from my phone...not much to control but I can see how many devices are on the signal, turn the device lights off/on, and see the speeds I'm uploading/downloading at.Also, the diagram says to centralize all the hubs, but due to the odd layout of our house it just wasn't possible. Even without the centralizing we have full signal in every room, including our garages and backyard. We basically cover 1/2 an acre!!! It's not full strength all over, but it's covers the space!We have been up and running solidly for a month now...no issues!The CONS-*I know I should list $$$, however I think the quality of the devices compared to the cost I've spent trying to get what this delivers is fairly comparable...I'd much rather spend the money once on one functional product than little bits at a time trying to make something work that just doesn't ever get there.*Ethernet outlets are limited.

Not really mentioned in the description, but the install instructions tell you that they pretty much need to be in line of sight of each other. My modem/router is in the garage (Good old Verizon FIOS installers) with 2-3 walls to get into the house and also have an upstairs with both a ceiling and a floor to get the signal through. Can't shoot it up the stairs as stairs have a landing and a 180 degree bend. Solved the upstairs problem by hooking the first one upstairs directly to the modem in the garage via a previously self installed Ethernet cable. Still thinking about the downstairs problem.

"mike w",08-Jan-2017,4,"Great upgrade in signal strength and WiFi speeds!","We have an older, 3000 sq ft house and had dead zones and performance problems with my old Airport Extreme router.  Decided to take the plung to this one for better coverage (I also wanted to reach our outdoor kitchen area where we sometimes set up a Fire TV stick and projector to watch a movie).  I'm not sure if it is the bump to AC or the mesh network, but the 3 eero devices have been amazing. Looking forward to being able to turn off my kid's wifi via Echo as well.I would give it 5 stars, except for 2 minor things:1. Manual parental controls are great (scheduling no internet times, turning off internet on demand), but I'd love for more granular control in the form of a couple of new features. First, some basic content filtering.  My kids are getting older, and I'd love some simple filtering to prevent them from getting to known bad sites. Second, maybe allow time limits (not time of day, but limiting active internet use to 2 hours, for example). This would be harder, because iPads / iPhones are always in the background doing something on the network, so determining &#34;active&#34; usage could be challenging.2. I cannot seem to get the port forwarding working. I have a Synology NAS running a web server with a wordpress blog, and I cannot seem to get it to allow the connection through.  Need to follow up with support, but the WiFi has been so great, I actually am OK with my web server being inaccessible in the meantime!Edit: I just got a response from eero support about the port forwarding.  So it seems that the port forwarding is working fine, but the eero does not support hairpin NAT / NAT loopback, which means I can't access my internal servers through the external domain / IP.  Not a huge issue, since internally I can simply access the server via my internal IP.  When I access my domain on any other network, it works fine. So, while it's still not fully resolved, they did get back to me in 2 days and provided an answer to why I though it wasn't working.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMP9CPPF29Z7H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3MH22GBU0JWHK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"RB",06-Jan-2017,2,"Setup process was too high of a security risk for me","This review is not for the eero’s wifi connection and performance, but for the setup requirements. I did not fully install the product because of privacy issues.I had read that there was an app involved in setting up the eero, but I didn't realize the amount of information that is shared via the app (as in, everything, I think). It was way too much of an invasion of my privacy, let alone the thought of someone hacking into eero’s data files and getting into any data remnants from this setup procedure.The information they initially required was:• Name• Email address• Mobile number (to send a verification code to the mobile number. Sorry, but why can’t they email it?)I grudgingly plugged in the above data (I really, really resent having to create an account for any app or product). Once the eero app found and registered the eero (which, kudos to them, took under 2 minutes), they then wanted to know:• Network name• PasswordHuh? Wha? They want me to type in my wireless account’s password into their unknown app? Are you kidding me?This was the point at which the cute little eero was boxed back up and shipped back. Sorry eero, ease of use does not mean giving up privacy in this household.(This review was going to be a single star, but since the packaging was as good as any of Apple's, and the setup process as far as it went was pain-free, I am guessing they have done a good job on the rest of their product.)","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3G6JRC5TUD2D1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2XLJ12AG4LYTH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"K.F.",04-Jan-2017,5,"Would definitely recommend","Despite a few hiccups, the system has been great.My setup: I have a ~1400 sq ft, 2 story home. I bought 2 eeros so that I could place one downstairs (with my modem) and one upstairs where I used to have issues with connectivity. Prior to purchasing the eero system I had a tplink router and a tplink wifi extender plugged in upstairs. This worked in some cases but I had issues with devices dropping the network and even one device that would/could not connect to the wifi at all. My home has a second floor hallway which is open to the first floor.Pros: I am getting faster internet. Devices are no longer dropping off the network. All my devices can now connect. The eero looks sleek and the app is pretty easy to use.Cons: The system seems to be a bit finicky when it comes to placement of the eeros. It said to have the eero at person level but the only way I could get the upstairs eero to connect was to move the downstairs eero up onto a ~8 ft high shelf. Now, the two eeros have line of sight without any walls but it was still a little bit of a dance to get them to &#34;see&#34; each other. Maybe once you have them connected you can move them more easily. I don't have a need to since it works as is, but it wasn't as straight forward a process as I had hoped. Enough to make it not worth it? No. Enough to mention? I think so. Also I messed up connecting an ethernet switch, but once I explained my problem, it was updated on the help site. All in all, I think highly of the company and the product.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6RWEH6Z8BKF6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A7AGJDVF8S196/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

All my devices have stable connections - the eero app makes administration super simple.

"DALJONES",03-Jan-2017,5,"Saved my kidney and my firstborn!","I rarely write reviews, but this has proven worthy of my efforts.  On many occasions over the past 10 years, my wifi network has caused me to seriously contemplate liquidating all of my assets and spending my remaining years tracking down the evil geniuses who created them.  I'm not particularly computer savvy, but I've always been able to follow online instructions to do port forwarding or create static ip's and the like.  This however has always been a trap, one that leads me to believe I can manage my wifi network and make it......actually work (imagine that).  After several different routers, a couple of range extenders and countless hours I would have rather been doing anything else, I finally gave up!  Following much research, I took the plunge and paid full price (gulp) for a 3 pack of the Eero's.  This has all been done with Time Warner Cable (if that matters).The Pros:1. It took me about 20 minutes to setup the network w/3 Eero's....easily the simplest setup I've ever done!2. My 2,000 sq. ft. 2 story house and my attached 1,000 sq. ft garage all have very strong wifi.3. I can nickname my devices so it's easy for me to see what's on the network.4. I easily grouped devices together that my kids use and set times they can't access wifi.5. I can access my network to pause/un-pause wifi for specific devices or for everything, even when I'm not home (using the iphone app).6. I've had it setup for about a week and it's been flawless!  All my speed tests in every area of the house are at my providers max capacity!7. I had a question about setting up the app for me and my wife.  I called in and was told they were experiencing high call volumes, but someone answered about 10 seconds later and quickly helped me get things done.8. The iPhone app interface is very easy to use....and it all makes sense.  They've simplified it to be used by actual human beings....ones that don't work on computers for a living.  An example:  I wanted to do some port forwarding....all I had to do was forward the port AND the app actually suggested that I make a static IP so I don't lose the port forwarding if the device doesn't connect to that ip in the future!  I always had to learn that the hard way.  Eero's then took me right to the screen to set the static ip!9. It actually works...everywhere...all the time...imagine that!Cons:1. Somewhat spendy.  However, it's much cheaper than a kidney, or my firstborn....which is what I was contemplating trading to anyone who could solve my wifi dilemmas.I'll update this review in the future if my Eero's turns on me, betrays my trust, or does anything else you should be warned about.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RP19IWS2JGXGF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A370IJ33B19Q76/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Kirk Strauser",03-Jan-2017,5,"I'm never building another router","I'm not going to detail my geek cred, but suffice it to say for these purposes that I usually build my own Linux-based routers. I'm not allergic to solder or compiling kernels. But I bought a 3-unit eero system over Thanksgiving and it's been a godsend.These networks aren't so much hubs as layer 2 switches. Know how your phone jumps from one station to another as you move through the house? How it's automatic and quick, but sometimes totally breaks the connection and makes Netflix stutter or VOIP calls drop? eero totally ends that. Connections are rock solid even as they bounce from one router to another. And they do bounce. If my kid and I are sitting on the couch using our phones, and both of us start streaming videos, eero is smart enough to push one of us off onto a different router so we're not interfering with each other's connection.I would not willingly go back to a handbuilt network now. I've only had a mesh network for a month and a half, but it's so much better than anything I'd pieced together myself that I'm retiring from the practice.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11EIEP4EOOA8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1QABB1MG53NYM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Robert",01-Jan-2017,4,"Outstanding wifi with capabilities my old network never had.","I am not tech savy, and have always been dependent on a local IT guy to set up and maintain my wifi network. All those router settings are like a foreign language to me. Our house is old, 4,000-plus square feet, single level, and made of brick with many interior brick walls. Our old wifi system required 4 routers, and we still had a few areas in the house with very poor signal. Each of the routers was connected to our main ATT Uverse router by ethernet cables.Eero setup is simplicity in itself. The eero app walks you right through it. I did encounter a glitch during setup, however, and this was related to my main router. Our internet service is through ATT Uverse. The ATT Uverse router must be put in bridge mode, or the eero system will not function properly. I spent a frustrating hour or so until I found this bit of information in the online help section. I wish eero had presented this information more prominently in the set up guide; this is why I took one star off my rating. Anyway, after a simple phone call to ATT (go directly to a service operator; don't try to use their automated menu system), I requested that they put my router in bridge mode, which they did remotely while I was speaking with the operator. After that, the eero system has worked flawlessly.I still needed 4 eero units to cover the house, the same number of routers as I had before; and all of the eeros are connected to the main router by ethernet cables as before. But now download speeds are better than I ever had, and every square inch of the house receives great signal, whereas before, there were parts of the house that had very low signal. Before, I was constantly having to reset my routers; I have had my eero system now for 2 months, and I have not had to reset any of the routers once. On my old network, I often had to manually change the wifi address settings on my device as I moved from one router zone to another; with the eero mesh network I no longer have that problem; and for the first time if my iPhone is in the bedroom, for instance, my Apple watch stays connected to it from anywhere in the house. Being able to monitor the status of my eero network through the app, which you can do from anywhere that you have access to the internet, is very cool. And I really love the independence I now have--I, a guy who never had any understanding of setting up a wifi network--of being able to set up and maintain my own wifi network.I cannot vouch for how well eero works using wireless connectivity between the routers, since all of mine are wired directly to my main ATT Uverse router via ethernet cables. I hope this review helps in the decision making process for any of you who are in a situation similar to mine.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DT4D77N3SW8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1H9IBG8R4WEG9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

I can now get 400+ Mbit/s all over my home, whereas before I'd be lucky to break 100. Pros:* Ethernet jack on every device. Unlike some of the competitors, this means  you can choose to hard wire some of the eeros for even better speeds (I used a MoCA bridge for this, which runs Ethernet over the existing cable connections in my house). Some of the competitors only have an Ethernet jack on a &#34;main&#34; device.* Simple setup.* Reliable network that Just Works. My phone automatically connects to the best network to maximize speed.* Can be used in &#34;bridge&#34; mode where the Eero's just acts as access points to my existing router. There are  a few downsides:* Need to make an account to set up the Eero in the app.* Needs an app at all. I have an iPhone right now, but I've previously used windows phone and might go back to it in the future and the fact that you need either an Android or iOS phone to do the setup is a bit worrying. I'd prefer if the &#34;app&#34; was just a web page served by the devices, so it could be accessed on any device, including a laptop.* No full IPv6 support. Not super critical right now I suppose, but a bit risky that it may not support this for the future (no problem if you use the Eero's in bridge mode though - as long as your existing router handles IPv6). This is the one and only reason I kept my existing router rather than just use Eero's for everything.For me personally it would be a 5 star review if the IPv6 thing gets addressed in a future update because it would mean I could just get rid of my traditional router altogether. The other cons are an annoyance but not enough to dock a star.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15M2W93ANZRJ1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AWHUHA7KB8FWR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Biff Henderson",29-Dec-2016,1,"Didn't work well for me. YMMV","I will admit that I'm in the minority of reviewers here, but this system just didn't work out for me and I'm rather underwhelmed at the product support.I had been running a home system with an apple extreme and a couple of airport expresses connected via LAN for extending the wifi network in my house (2-story, fairly large). Had worked very well ,with the sole exception that when moving around the house using wifi, the various base stations wouldn't hand off very efficiently, holding on to a weak signal even when a stronger one was available (had to switch wifi on a device off and back on to get the better signal). A minor inconvenience, but otherwise fairly robust setup. I run three media servers and  Sonos system in which most of the units are on the LAN but do have a couple on the Sonos wireless net. Worked pretty flawlessly with the above exception.In any event, the idea of a true mesh network sounded like the solution to my roaming issues. My concern with a system like the Eero was the cloud-based nature of the system, lack of diagnostic tools at my disposal to help solve problems, and the phone/tablet-app-only interface. So I threw the dice. Set up was fairly straight forward with the iPhone app. The problem I had from the start, however, was intermittent short drop outs of internet service and connections to my network servers. I'm talking about 5-10 second intervals where streaming would stop, Skype calls drop, loss of connection to my music library (on a NAS), about several times an hour. Worse, after the first few days, the app on my iPhone couldn't even connect with the Eero system, yet that system remained connected to the internet and continued to route signals (with the above problems). Unfortunately, this was just before Christmas and I figured tech support would be sparse so I waited 'til just after Christmas to call. Got level one support which was fairly useless (&#34;never heard of that problem before&#34;), was kicked up to level 2, but that entailed waiting for an email response. 24 hours later, heard back from tech support acknowledging the ticket and letting me know they would get back to me &#34;in a few days&#34; when they had some sort of answer.This left me high and dry so I swapped out the system for my old setup and am back up and running just great with my previous set-up.Now, I'm willing to admit that my network my be atypical with multiple media servers, a Sonos system, reserved IP addresses, etc., but the lack of ability to interface with the router in any meaningful way, and, in my experience at least, marginal customer support, to be suboptimal for a product of this nature in this price range. I'm fairly tech-savvy so usually can solve problems without the need for tech support, but with a system like this, you're kind of stuck.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NRL5TCPRJFYP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1I1MTEDPQKTCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"David Galuhn",29-Dec-2016,5,"Eero Home WiFi Mesh Network Made Simple","I bought the Eero WiFI mesh system primarily to boost the signal for my Smart 55&#34; TV in the Living Room.  The Eero WiFi System is simple to install, I think I was up and running within 20-30 minutes.  The most amazing thing is my speed test for the Smart TV increased 5 times (Download Speed) which means I no longer have annoying buffering while while watching Grand Tour or, House of Cards - Can't have that.  I have recommended this product to people at work who have claimed similar increases in their WiFi performance.  I totally recommend this product!!  The price for this through Amazon is the same at Best Buy.  I much rather buy through Amazon because my purchases here benefits Omni Nano.NOTE: Eero recommends getting a twin pack for homes and apartments which are less than 2,000 square feet in area.  My 2-Story Townhome with 1,800 square feet is well covered by the this system.

"WolfX5",26-Dec-2016,5,"Great product but be aware of some SERIOUS PRIVACY ISSUES WITH USING EERO...","First let me say that this product works well and have solved a very difficult wifi coverage issue for my business.  I am getting my full 50MB download speed at the Eero connected to my router and about 30 - 40MB on average around the office, sometimes in places where I got literally ZERO connection before Eero, so I'm pleased with it's performance. What I'm NOT pleased about is the invasion of privacy that Eero products seem to come bundled with. In essence, because you MUST use the Eero app to set up the network, and that software ONLY comes as an Android phone or Iphone app (IOS on Ipad is NOT supported!), you are basically FORCED to give Eero a working cellular phone number linked to your account. Also, because Google enforces cell phone authentication now when you download Android apps, if you use Eero's Android app and you've never given Google your actual cell phone number you will have to do that too just to get the Eero app loaded on your phone. Ridiculous. No doubt both Eero and Google could use your cellular number to tie every bit of your web traffic to the owner of the cellular phone if they so choose which doesn't bode well for privacy advocates. There also doesn't appear to be a way for Eero to enforce MAC authentication so if you're used to using specific MAC addresses to limit what devices can connect to your router you are out of luck. Anyone who can sniff your wifi traffic and decrypt it will have full access to your network. I frankly think it is entirely disrespectful of a company to force you into this situation and if it wasn't for the absolute necessity of having Wifi coverage using Eero I would have chosen another vendor because of these privacy concerns.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FICHRSDH8HZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1SM3YUTM0C135/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"J. L. Coddington",26-Dec-2016,5,"Router Nirvana","Before eero, one of our computers would disconnect from WiFi frequently and we had occasional buffering issues with Netflix and Amazon Video on our smart televisions. I should also mention that In the last couple of years we've added two tablets, an Amazon Echo, an Echo Dot, a device that monitors our rooftop solar panels, a Joule sous vide, a Hue bridge and several WiFi-enabled LED light bulbs. Projecting that there will be more smart devices to come in the near future, we needed to act. After researching routers and router extenders, it was decided that the eero system would be our best option. A hefty price break sealed the deal and we purchased a three pack. Since the eero system was put into service to blanket the house, we've had no further connectivity issues. Installation was incredibly simple--all devices connected easily and they work as they are supposed to. As non-techies, automatic updates are a big plus; there is no wondering if our router is up-to-date (if it wasn't, we wouldn't have known how to update it anyway). Unlike our previous routers, eero's appearance is sleek and unobtrusive. We like our eero system so much that we will be ordering another one or two for our vacation home shortly.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2G9OMEADO9ZM4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AEN53KFZD8RYF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

Setting up several units took less than 20 minutes.  When choosing eero, this was one of the factors that influenced my decision over Netgear's product in which the app appeared dated (at least at the time I'm writing this).Most importantly though is that eero just works.  I struggled with random dead spots all over my home (despite having repeaters literally 15 ft from the devices) and I am no longer having this issue.While certainly more expensive than many products, the product does what it's supposed to do and delivers coverage all over my house.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1X37IGF6T3BV9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AOOI9XQ4E1S93/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Jeff",25-Dec-2016,1,"Great Product - Sub Par Support","Two parts to this review.First part is the hardware. Hardware is beautiful looking, super easy to set up, performance is awesome for my home, and the attention to detail of the product is spectacular. You are purchasing a system of routers that will completely cover your home in reliable wifi coverage. It looks like a modern &#34;apple designed&#34; device and has a beautiful app that is iOS and android friendly. No support for a computer to set up and monitor the system though that's not a huge deal.Second part is the support of the purchase of the product. Support of this item lacks common sense. You might never know when to purchase this item. Buy it now. You might loose out on a promotion. Also the experience I received when asking for assistance. Here is the story about the experience with Eero and Amazon Customer Service. I bought this as a early adopter of the &#34;mesh network&#34; items full price 500 bucks. It went on promotion 2 days after receiving it. Called eero and was told that I needed to talk to the seller. Called Amazon and uncovered there is No Policy or support to give me the difference while keeping the product. Instead they told me to re-purchase to get the promo price, THIS IS Amazon Customer Service's solution...To have over 1k in charges until the other was returned for Realiable Wi-Fi. So I return it, and go to rebuy it.... It's off the special promotion I find. Called Amazon informed me there was/is nothing they can do is not on special. I was advised that I needed to wait to buy it again. They mentioned that if I would have bought a TV they could have helped me. So to recap. Bought the $500 3 pack. Had to return it. Lost money as I had to pay to return it. Tried to get the promotion again and it was off promo. In the mean time I am getting email from eeros marketing telling me that I can get 100 off and to purchase it today.

"Retired Engr",24-Dec-2016,5,"The 3 devices come well packaged and appear to be robustly built with a good quality finish","I have a 3 story condo and my wi fi wasn't reaching from the bottom to top floor.  I had tried a range extender and, while it allowed me to get an adequate signal where I added the extender, there were still a number of weak spots plus my devices wouldn't always change networks properly.  I read all the reviews on the eero system and finally decided to give it a try.  Most of the reviews I read have already hit the high points.  The 3 devices come well packaged and appear to be robustly built with a good quality finish.  I didn't have any issues setting up the devices using my iPhone; I was up and running in less than 30 minutes.  My signal strength/download rates were improved significantly throughout the house and now there is no need to switch networks since the mesh approach makes the devices look like one network.  After installation, I wanted to move one of the devices for improved coverage; so sent a test to eeros to make sure I knew how.  The response came shortly and it turned out you just unplug the device from its current location and plug it in in the new location; everything synchs up automatically.  I've been running for a couple of months now and everything is still working great.  I definitely would recommend this product.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2THS4ORM7XNO2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1NIU2SLK53ZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

This is closest system to approximating distributed wired APs performance-wise that I have found. Unlike mesh systems that use store and forward, there is no hop speed reduction or added latency. It just works! This is my go-to solution now for setting up whole-home wifi systems for clients that want to use their gadgets all over their (usually larger) homes. There's very little in the way of customization that IT geeks like myself might appreciate, but for the vast majority of folks that just want reliable wi-fi, this is the answer.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1N1AMUFWT2MQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2546ZHOWN3S8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"N.T.",22-Dec-2016,5,"After years of struggles, finally a solution that works BRILLIANTLY.","As the tech guy in my family, I have spent many, many years being the recipient of nonstop complaints about how bad the internet is in the apartment my parents live in. They have an account with Comcast and are signed up for the 150MB/s service. With the Motorola box provided from Comcast, even in non-peak hours, the fastest speeds I could get were about 40-60 MB/s download. Now, the real struggle begins when you take into consideration the layout of the apartment. When the apartment was designed in the 80s, the designer decided it would be a nice idea to put mirrors on almost every wall in the apartment. As many of you may know, a mirror will absolutely obliterate a Wi-Fi signal - now imagine a 4,000-square foot apartment full of mirrored walls... Needless to say I've had my hands full on every visit to them. I’ve tried EVERY solution in the books and up until now nothing has worked. It’s been a nightmare.Then comes along Eero... Let me say - what a LIFE CHANGER. First off, putting the Comcast modem / router combo device into bridged mode and setting up that first Eero box literally DOUBLED the wireless speed. My speedtest results went from the above mentioned to a consistent 110-130 MB/s. HUGE improvement. And then I proceeded to install the other 2 Eero units in a couple key locations across the apartment and the results are astonishing. In my mother's workspace, the wireless speeds were about 5-10 MB/s and the signal would quite often drop completely interrupting downloads and whatever else with the old setup. After getting the Eero system set up, she was getting a consistent 90MB/s download with not even a hint of instability. That’s over 90 linear feet from the main Eero box through 2 fully mirrored walls… I mean, what is this wizardry?I will say that this solution is expensive, and certainly not for everyone. But if you have any of the unusual issues that prevent traditional Wi-Fi setups like I have had, you literally don’t have to look elsewhere. Eero is a game changer, and has literally revolutionized my parent’s existence. My hat is off to the team behind this product. Bravo.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CXUJMEPBYS74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A278OU34A3CR19/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Kishore",17-Dec-2016,3,"I would say NOTHING exists that is perfect at this time","review 12/17/16Eero with three access points function at least as well as three separate access points (any brand) on the same SSID.  I wired all three of my eero units to wifi in order to handle the &#34;backhaul&#34;.The fundamental problem with this setup:  Apple devices such as iphone 6s and the late 2016 macbook pro with touch bar (absolute latest devices available from Apple) do not handoff from one eero to another without dropping connection.  The handoff from access point to access point varies from 1 to 10 seconds depending who knows what.  You WILL DROP VOIP CALLS or IPHONE/IMUSIC/AIRPLAY streams during handoff.  It is NOT ANY different in performance compared to having multiple airport express access points.If all you want is more broad coverage of wifi, any number of solutions will be feasible. If you want SEAMLESS transition, I would say NOTHING exists that is perfect at this time.Apple has no way of knowing how many access points you have and it clearly does not scan or actively trade access points until your bandwidth drops into oblivion and you lose connection first.  Even then, the handoff is way too slow to reconnect.It is possible in addition that the foam insulation in my house is causing more radio reflections and slowing things down even further.  But that makes my point even more important:  the challenging house is where you would want an eero to work... and that's exactly where it won't.People seem to have reported poor results in other wifi discussions with apple products in terms of handoff between access points.  Unless devices are actively scanning with a second wifi antenna and pre-connecting, you won't get the desired results.  Another option might be if a device was connected to two signals at once.I am going back to me centrally placed asus router so that I can do Iphone over wifi with AT&T since my cell reception sucks in my house.  I lose some phone coverage at certain corners of my house, but this is something I am going to have to live with.  I suspect nothing important will change in my house until wifi technology moves towards a true mesh network at some point.SEAMLESS HANDOFF is what we are looking for Eero and Apple.  Eero is falsely advertising until this can be done.  Eero bears responsibility for not warning the average user that their product won't work with all clients.  I am clearly not the average user and so I was able to figure out that this is not going to work no matter how much I screw around with it.I gave this 3 stars but I should have been much more harsh for wasting half my day on this nonsense.  I am curious how many people who installed an Eero are predominantly just on one AP and therefore are reporting good results.  If someone has any further theories, I am willing to hear them...","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MBWZ1SZQAZK7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A168PA619DSF8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"David M. Benedict",15-Dec-2016,3,"Good coverage but be prepared for minor ""outages""","*** UPDATE ***Since I wrote this review, v2.10 came out and this seems to have fixed the disconnect issues I was having.===============================So far I love the reach this WiFi has.  The setup is extremely easy and can be done via an app.  Speeds are good. The router actually runs tests every now and then on its own (I think upon first boot up and once every 3-5 days or so).  I am using it in bridge mode to my Cisco 325RV so l can't try out the family management features or address assignment.  It is very tempting so that I can cut my tween off to get her attention. :)Now for the bad part.  It often seems I am getting disconnected.  My unprofessional guess is this is when the router is trying to push you over to the 5ghz band and it disconnects the device from 2.4ghz to try to achieve this.  If you are looking to be able to select what radio channel you are out of luck (for now at least.. Maybe that will change).  There is also no way to reboot the router (which almost seems mandatory after an internet outage).  I have submitted this as a feature request for the app.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3D8PVJFIXDTXC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A305MLAXZ2HU2L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

I thoroughly changed my mind several times but never felt completely decided.  I liked Eero from the start, but was put off by the price.  Would have gone with Google Wifi but the performance didn't measure up.  Amplifi was an early pick but ultimately the unsightly style of the remote antenna turned me away.  And despite Orbi's superior speed, those things are HUGE to leave sitting out on the table.  Ultimately I was sold by Eero's amazing commitment to service, support, and features.  The latest 2.0 firmware upgrade has seen significant performance improvements.We have a central column in the middle of our townhouse with plumbing, AC, walls, etc. that notoriously blocked the central upstairs' wifi signal to much of the downstairs.  Where we did get signal it was degraded and slow.  Out of the box last night I had the first device up and connected via the app in under 10 minutes.

I'm in a house from 1924, and it was built in sections, meaning some of the interior walls were once thick exterior walls.  However, my apple extreme with apple express satellites had no trouble sharing signals through them.  The reason I wanted to try eero was not poor signal strength, but erratic performance with the Apple.  The guidelines for setting up the eero stations - 40 feet maximum with line of sight and no walls between - seem absurd to me.  In one case, I had the satellite 16 feet away, within line of sight, and it still came back with &#34;poor connection,&#34; which keeps you from moving forward in the setup process at all.To get the satellite stations on line, I've moved them close enough, and though it seems they're not far enough out to reach my target spots for better wifi, I ran speed test this morning and eero is out-performing Apple Extreme by a wide margin.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OETWO8QR4KLC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3SBUMI1XB19Y4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

I live in a 2nd floor one bedroom apartment and my boyfriend lives in another one bedroom on the first floor in the same complex.  There is a big 3 bedroom townhouse style apartment in between them.  Previously I had the newest Apple Airport Extreme in my place and we had an Apple Airport Express in his to repeat my connection.  His internet was always pretty weak and unreliable (he confessed just how bad only after we installed the eero).  After doing some research into mesh network router systems and seeing the great reviews for the eero system (and the fact that it was $100 off the usual price) I decided to give it a try.  I got the pack of 3 expecting to have the main one in my place right up against the wall and the 2nd and 3rd in his place to cover the whole apartment.Initial setup of the first unit with the eero iPhone app was a breeze.  The app also found the second but said the connection was too weak after several attempts.  I was bummed so I told the app to stop trying at which point it said there was an update available for the main unit.  After the update I tried to connect to the 2nd again and it worked.  Then the app ran the update for the 2nd.  Those 2 alone were all we needed to COMPLETELY blanket his apartment (back to the farthest corner) and mine.  I setup the 3rd (and let run the update) just because we had it.The app provides so much great information and is super easy to use.  This is a system I fully expect to keep for many many years as it can grow and adjust to whatever living situation we find ourselves in.Only negative I can say is that the USB port on the eero can't yet be used to connect an external hard drive for file sharing so for now my Airport Extreme is continuing to do that job on my network after adjusting it's settings to be in Bridge Mode only.  It's an extra annoying piece of tech that I hope I can retire in the coming months if eero adds that functionality via an update.I highly recommend the eero Home WiFi System.  Depending on your home situation you might even want to start with only one or two and see how well they cover the area before adding more.  The flexibility, reliability, coverage, and ease of use make this the very BEST WiFi system I have ever owned (and I've had just about every router Apple released).","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYFEJVQGRVTJ1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1UDDNFQ2N8MVZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

(My Airport Extreme was upstairs and the MoCA-fed Airport Express was downstairs but in a different room than either of the Nest cameras.)So I decided to jump to eero technology, and I'm happy I did. (I picked eero over Luma in part because eero was able to take advantage of rooms with an Ethernet feed and so could also take advantage of my MoCA.)The most-important benefit to me has been rock-solid connections for my two Nest cameras.Given that it looks like Apple might be retiring its Airport lines, this seems like a prescient transition for me (and also absolves this Apple loyalist of any guilt from moving away from Apple's Wi-Fi ecosystem). 😉","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7R9D8BUDZGZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A17X1FE00SH0ES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"SPMc",03-Dec-2016,3,"Product has potential but lacking some basic configuration settings","I so much wanted this solution to providing a seamless Wi-Fi network to work but despite some good features it needs some improvement and updates for me to rate it more than 3 stars.  As so many reviewers have stated the set up was very quick and easy. I had 2 of the 3 units up in less than 30 minutes and that included the time for software updates that came down immediately.  Signal strength was very good and I did not have any issues with any devices (iPad, 2 laptops, 2 Galaxy S6 phones) connecting but was only on the 2.4 GHz network.  All these devices connect to my original hardware on the 5 GHz band so with eero I was connecting at half the speed.  Upon further investigation using wifi analyzer I found I was on a busy channel from overlapping neighbors.  I could not find any settings in the phone app interface to alter the configuration so called tech support.  I was told unfortunately there is no option at this time to manually set or change the channel selection. Tech support told me this might be future update as many other callers have asked for it.  Also you cannot configure the units to only use the 5 GHz band nor can you turn off the SSID broadcast.  For me these are some basic settings present in most Wi-Fi routers so I was very disappointed by lacking in this current release of the product.In summary this product might be fine solution for many users in most environments, but the following shortcomings are why I am returning the product.• Product needs to be able to view/edit via a web interface, not just using a phone app.• Need to be able to configure to turn on/off 2.4 GHz or 5GHz network speed• Set channel frequency band• Use MAC authentication• Turn off SSID broadcast","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10D7JZZ0492HF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AVBR6DCV73GMD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"QK Shopper",03-Dec-2016,5,"Simply Fantastic. Have better coverage all through my sprawling ranch home than I've had through years of different ""solutions""","I am 1 week into having eero set up at home and four days in at my small business. My home is a good size, sprawling ranch. I've had trouble for the whole time I have lived here getting consistent wifi coverage all over the house. Two particular problems were the master bedroom (which is on the other side of the house from where the internet signal comes in on DSL) and the basement. I've used two (and sometimes three) apple wifi routers (two extremes sometimes with one airport) along with trying various other supplemental wifi options (those powerline type devices, or even setting up a separate WIFI coming off one of the extremes to try to push signal into the basement), etc etc etc.  I'm vey technical and have been chronically frustrated.I literally set up the whole eero system in less about 15 minutes. It was ridiculously easy. I was compelled by their two way radios (one set for the eero devices to communicate with each other about which was doing what) and one for pushing signal around the house (most wifi systems with extenders of any sort are doing everything on one set of radios, even if many antennas).Okay, 1 week in, Totally amazed. This has fixed EVERYTHING I had struggled with for at least a decade in this house. It's amazing. The signal on my wifi now is strong everywhere in the house, like amazing conveyance of speed I have to work with, strong. It's even made my Ring Doorbell work much better (and that was quite a frustration in itself due to wifi issues). Best part of all: Master bedroom how have huge bandwidth and strong connection to wifi.  And, I've never had as good of connection as I do now in my basement office. My Apple computer in basement is seeing speeds it has never enjoyed before. I am a fan.Adding to this the regular updates and patches (which is not done on most other routers), I am supremely happy. So happy, got another system for the real office away from my home. I have an issue still to work through there to get my Macs to see the server through the eero (PCs all see it perfectly), but that will resolve once I meet with my tech quy and adjust some things. But the perfection of this solution at my house.  Wow. I was hesitant to spend THIS much money but now I'm so glad this option exists and I'd have paid even more to have it.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15TNXUI2SNNK7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1A306IAZ3TM1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Mark J. Rubash",02-Dec-2016,1,"I'm fortunately to have 300 MB service from Comcast and saw ...","BEWARE OF DRAMATICALLY SLOW INTERNET SPEEDS!!!  Purchased the three-pack and installed without any problems. Unfortunately, the speed at each eero after the 1st one connected to my cable modem cuts the available speeds in half! I'm fortunately to have 300 MB service from Comcast and saw this speed on eero #1, at eero #2 the speed dropped down to 45 MB and at #3 was about 40 MB.  In both cases, the eero app indicated that connection between devices was excellent with all bars lit. Also, the performance after upgrading to version 2.0 of the firmware was WORSE than before the upgrade! After a fair amount of research, I learned that this bandwidth drop-off is a design flaw in that bandwidth is being used for backhaul and connecting the three eero devices. I decided to give ORBI a try (as their approach utilizes a proprietary third wireless band for backhaul and connectivity, thereby preserving the 2.4 and 5 ghz bands for use solely by connected devices). I currently have two ORBIs installed (router and satellite) and achieve 295 MB to 65 MB throughout a 6,300 sf two-story home. I plan to add a second ORBI satellite when they become available and expect I'll be well about 150 MB in every room of the house. If you have a smaller home and can place your eero devices fairly close together (20 feet) with NO obstructions, then you might be happy enough.  For me, eero dramatically underperformed the ORBI in a high-bandwidth environment and seemed much more like a kickstarter beta product. Netgear has been making routers and wireless gear for decades and that experience clearly showed in the Orbi product. It's not as simple to setup as eero, but that shortfall is more than made up for by the high bandwidth capability and advanced router functionality.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MWZLHO6A2YLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3ERXU0FIVJOJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

It's two stories with 1300 square feet on each story. I can get signal with my iPhone from every location in my house with the ASUS router but it's flaky at the far reaches from the router, as expected.I followed all the steps and did my best to not try anything a normal home user wouldn't do. I can get the base unit working, plugged into my cable modem. However, I cannot get another EERO device to mesh connect from a _reasonable_ location. I respected the &#34;within 40 feet, preferably line-of-sight&#34; guideline and placed an EERO at about 32 feet away with line of sight. I don't understand what good this system is if I have to place devices even closer together.The solo EERO that I connected worked well enough which I why I chose 2 stars. The configuration software is very bare bones.

When I called tech support, it took 25 minutes to get someone (the app has a callback feature...which called me within seconds of requesting a phone call...but then kept me waiting) versus Eero which answered in seconds. Both tech support folks were friendly, but the Google person felt more bound to a script and punted on some basic questions. For example &#34;How secure is the firewall on the Google wifi?&#34; question led to this answer &#34;Google wifi has WEP2 passwords.&#34;) The Eero person felt like they were actually providing tech support.Google: I found out in the set up that bridge mode doesn't allow for guest ssid (?!?!). I know many wont need bridge mode, but I don't understand that design. Also, the tech support told me that bridge mode essentially reduces Google wifi to 3 separate access points with different names, which is basically what I have with the Apple Airports I have now. So the Google is going back, and I'm ordering Eero again if I can somehow get the same black friday deal I originally ordered under.Eero: I sent them back on an annoyance with the app,but I hope that has been fixed.

An email to Eero support was promptly responded to, however they pointed me back to AT&amp;T as it's supposedly a known issue that their routers don't come with a bridge mode. To cut a long, boring story short; while I'm sure I'll find a solution at some point, if you're looking for a simple solution to internet coverage / speed issues, while it will improve both (as it has for me), it's far from the easy solution it claims to be.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RI45R3K3JZZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3H2EBKOM5HGCU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

These worked ok but I still could only get between 18 and 46 Mbps. I was thinking this was as good as it was going to get until I saw the eero product.I purchased the 3-pack and was impressed with how easy it was to setup (via iPhone app). Connected the first to the basement modem which created a new WiFi network and then connected the others throughout the house. I placed one on the first floor and one on the second floor. The eero app you download helps to get everything setup and could not believe how easy it was. I am now consistently running between 112-125 Mbps regardless of where I am at in the house. I also run multiple Xbox one consoles and Netflix, YouTube, etc. are no longer dropping connections.I was able to get the $100 discount so my price for the 3 pack was $399. For me it was well worth because frustration with dropped or slow connections has stopped.One quirk is that after setting up one of the eero, I had to move it but could not get it to reconnect. My solution was to remove it from the network with the iPhone app, reset the device (on the back of the eero using a needle/safety pin), and then adding back to the network using the app. Worked great after that.Would definitely recommend this although the price is a little steep.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMG9R5Q9XWG52/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A223AZWJ2XOLWP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

Reichert",26-Nov-2016,3,"Updated - Works great but is not flawless - Support lets it down","Update 12/3/16 (removed 2 stars): I have a strange problem with eero where virtual machines running on Hyper-V on my laptop struggle to get IP settings from the network's DHCP server. It works about 40% of the time but the other 60% of the time it will either not get any settings or the DHCP server will give it the same IP address as the host machine, causing a network clash.Their technical support seems to be unable to diagnose the problem and not knowledgeable enough (one person asked me what are virtual machines).

I'm getting ready to return this item as soon as I can locate someone that has Google Wifi in stock.Original review:This is a step into the future of home networks.When we moved into our house, an average two-storey family house, I put a Comcast Xfinity Gateway router in the front room next to the cable outlet and the wireless connection to it was shockingly bad. It was really only usable within the same room. I tried other solutions to extend the network but always ended up with two SSIDs that we had to switch over and dark spots where there was no signal.The eero fixed it. 3 boxes spread around my house and now I have strong, fast WIFI everywhere. No dark spots.The setup was super easy, all done via the phone app. Within minutes I had the first box set up with the network created and adding the extra boxes was super quick. No hitches or issues.And now I have the peace of mind that if I move to a bigger house or get a dark spot anywhere I can just buy an extra box and throw it in the system and boom, problem solved. I have only one SSID and can seamlessly use the internet walking from room to room.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33EPDU96E0ZP9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2F1VLX7BHY96U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

While Eero customer service is helpful and responsive their fix to the problem is to hard wire non working devices by moving them close to an Eero device or to buy a new printer.  None of which were tenable solutions.  For $530 my expectation is that I'll have wifi and not have to hard wire anything - or purchase additional equipment particularly if those same devices worked seamlessly with my $100 router.  In any event after working with Eero for quite some time I decided that it wasn't worth the expense or hassle.  I was told I couldn't return it because now it was past 30 days.On black Friday they offered $100 off a system.  I again wrote the company suggesting they provide the credit and I would apply it to a additional single Eero - cost $150 - so I could hardwire my printer.

"Eric H.",26-Nov-2016,4,"Nice! Be careful with ""bridged"" mode at least until the next software update (after 2.0.0).","I bought this for myself after having successfully deployed 2 other eero 3 pack systems. For those installations I used a powerline adapter to attach the main eero and the most remote eero with the thinking that a &#34;wired backhaul&#34; was more stable/reliable than the wireless mesh backhaul and could provide better communication to the non-wired eero. I also let the main eeros in those setups &#34;be in charge&#34; and handle routing etc (the default/preferred setup).For my setup which a little more complex as I have a dedicated firewall computer and several subnets. I initially tried to use the main eero in &#34;bridge&#34; mode. This proved to be somewhat unreliable. Was getting dropoffs and network lags. Support reported that there is currently a bug with bridging for some people and that it would be addressed in an upcoming patch. I did not want to wait so switched over the main eero to &#34;automatic&#34; instead of bridged and put it &#34;in front of&#34; my home subnet - a double NAT configuration. For the other two eeros - one was connected via powerline to the home subnet and the other was via the mesh (wireless backhaul).Things seem to be working a lot better so far. I did have to do some tricky port routing etc for things like my slingboxes thanks to the double NAT setup but really it wasn't that bad. As a bonus I have a bit more wireless and network control features available to me - profiles etc and that's nice.I'm happy so far - support has been great, product seems to work as expected but still a little early in the game. An old nexus 7 device did initially have some connection issues with the new setup but that seems to have gone away as of this morning.I am looking at adding another eero to round out my setup - primary one in the basement, 2 on the main floor (either side of the house one wired other powerline wired) and 1 upstairs (wireless mesh).","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7BIH59QIYAL5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3U7ODSZU7Y53A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Jeremy Brown",25-Nov-2016,1,"Wifi drops constantly","I bought an Eero to replace my trusty-but-old Airport Base Station which was showing signs of flakiness after 5 or so years.  I wanted something similar to the Airport in ease of configuration, but without having to be configured from software running on a Mac OS machine (which is really heavy handed when I just want to tweak something).  A few friends recommended the Eero, and I'd seen good reviews online, so I decided to give it a try.On the positive side, the Eero is incredibly simple to set up, and the phone app works well.  However I could just never get consistent wireless performance out of it.  One moment it would appear to be working fine; the next moment multiple machines would lose their wifi connections, and I'd have to sit there and unplug / plug in the device and reboot phones until finally things would work again.  A desktop that literally sits about 2 feet from the device would constantly lose its wifi connection.  I eventually had to just wire as many things as possible directly using wired Ethernet, and that seems more reliable.Some cursory Internet research seems to indicate that the problem might be because the Eero doesn't support configuring the wifi channel it uses [...].  If so that would explain why my wifi is so bad with the device; I live in a dense city with 10+ wifi networks visible from my apartment, so there is lots of interference.  It's possible if I lived in a less dense area the Eero would work better, but given how poorly it performs for me I can't recommend it.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31MZJQNE1HFZ5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1PST1QBTBOIX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"DMJ",25-Nov-2016,5,"simple, effective, successful -- I'll try to forget the price.","I have a four story town house with Verizon Fios coming in at the lowest level.  With an Apple router of the latest design I got very good speed on the first level, but already on the second with my smartphone I sometimes lost a bar, and despite a signal extender the signal was slow and weak on higher floors.A three pack from Eero fixed us up, and the setup took only a few minutes.  The setup is guided by the smartphone app, which worked flawlessly.  First, you unplug your router and disconnect whatever you've been using for wi-fi.  Then you run an ethernet cable from your router to the first Eero, turn on the power, and follow the very simple directions in the app.  Very soon you are registered, you name the network and the password, and Eero no. 1 is pumping out signal.  Then I went up to the kitchen, on the second level, and powered up No. 2 there.  You then bring it to life with the app, again following VERY simple instructions.  Then I went up to the fourth level and plugged in the final one, again following the app's instructions.

I had a problem before and tried to contact the customer support, their response was super, I got personal help one on one who patiently helped me find the problem.

From the start, I experienced consistent drop offs in coverage (much more than my prior equipment) and the most recent software update (11/17) has completely incapacitated one of the four units I'm using. The app has no troubleshooting instructions for this situation and simply directs me to a generic support webpage for contact options, as if I want to spend an hour helping them debug a standard installation like this. It's particularly disappointing to have a software update actually degrade my service, sigh.Maybe the moral of the story is never buy first-version products like this for a crucial function like networking.

"Brandon",15-Nov-2016,2,"Initial set up was great and easy","I've been using the Eero system for about 6 months now and unfortunately I just can't put up with it anymore.  Initial set up was great and easy, then the software bugs started.  I spoke to Eero many times in the first month regarding issues that to their credit they resolved very quickly with updates to their code.  Most of the issues arose from having a slightly more advance network in place than I think they expect the average buyer to have.  But as I said their customer service was quick and friendly (all knew me by name) and fixed everything they could on their end.  Then the hardware problems started.  Within the first week one of the units died.  Since then four more have died.  The replacements are always sent promptly and the last one they identified as dead before I did.  I realized it was dead when I got an RMA email to send it back.  Now I'm back to software and connection issues.  This evening, for the 3rd time in the past month the ethernet connection on one of the units has stopped working and the only thing that will fix it is removing it from the network, hard resetting, and then readding it back in which now isn't nearly as reliable as it used to be.I will say that when the devices are up and running the experience in nice and throughput is decent so long as you don't keep sustained demand on them.  Unfortunately for me that hasn't been something I've been able to keep consistently.  I'm retiring these and starting the search for another alternative.  Like I mentioned earlier they're a great company and have great support, unfortunately their product hasn't lived up to the rest of the experience for me.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1J4HCVTE28QUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A6DOX89ZPL6T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

But did I need them at home?  Turn out that I don't.  And supporting all of them was a day to day.  Ending on mutiple trips back home or calls from my sons and wife to get back online.  And explain then what to do was not simple.  The old turn off and back on became not just a funny request.So, I got eero, and it took me 5 minutes to install it.  I was able to use my CAT5E backbone that I already had at home.  Results?  100% WIFI coverage and I have a concrete home with lots of steel and concrete walls.  eero was able to provide full coverage in all floors.  Even the basement.Now I know who's at home, who is using it.  Whats speed I'm getting directly from the cable modem router, carrier test was only valid directly from the modem. I can do that remotely now and still have a test directly from the modem.

First test was to try up on the 2nd floor two stories above the router and best I could do before was 10-12 MB speeds.

"John K. Dragoon",03-Nov-2016,4,"Great...but beware if you prefer 5 ghz over 2.4 ghz for speed.","I live in a brownstone condo in downtown Boston.  A crowded area with a lot of competition for bandwidth, channels and frequencies.  My Apple Router worked ok when in range but couldn't reach the 2nd floor.  An additional Apple Airport Extreme as an extender worked ok not great.  Hence my search for the Eero.  Given the overcrowded competition for 2.4 ghz in my neighborhood I configured a 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz wireless network on the Apple router and was able to choose which of the two networks I could join in my condo based on signal strength.  The 5 ghz network FAR outperformed the 2.4 ghz at speeds over 100 mps download for the 5 vs 10 mps or less on the 2.4 ghz network.While the setup of the Eero was easy, there is NO option to configure both a 2.4 and 5 ghz network  The router simultaneously broadcasts both and chooses for you which network, based on signal strength it connects to.  I want the ability to override the automatic connection and force a connection to the 5 ghz Eero network given the speed advantages.  Unfortunately you can't do that. I called Eero tech support and they are aware of the limitation with no commitment to fix.While I love the improved signal strength of the Eero mesh throughout my condo, my inability to choose connection to a 5 ghz network (and therefore suffer much slower speeds) is a major drawback.Net, if you depend or strongly prefer 5 ghz wireless networks - you will not be able to choose this as default option on Eero.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7G1GD77K9RGP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3GZM5JO0DMBZZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Tom",25-Oct-2016,4,"Poor setup procedure","The detectors are great. They work as advertised and are easily monitored and controlloed from my cell phone.The setup is where they could have done better. I bought 5 of these and wanted them all to be interconected. They are and it works great. However, they fail to tell you that you have to activate each detector in the chain when seting up a new one. Even the scond and third from the original three pack. When setting these up, after activating it it tells you to go ahead and install it. If you do you will have to get it and activate it for the setup of the new detector to complete. I had to have all four in the chain going when I set up the fifth.So, If you're installing more than one of these. Sit at a table and do all the setup at once while your comfortable. I would have rate these five stars, but I think this is a VERY MAJOR flaw in the set up. I don't believe they're unaware of the problem, so there doing this on purpose. Not what I'm looking for in a tech company.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQ7LAU3TM5EBH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AFIL2RXLHDIOF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Andrew Stuckey",25-Oct-2016,5,"Simple, sleek and it works","I gotta say I am impressed with this system.  Crazy easy to set up and no more large router with antenna sticking out everywhere in my living room.  Like most, I was concerned about the cost of the product for a company/brand that I have never heard of.  But I've been tired of my existing Wifi network so I knew I was going to go with a full system rather than a standalone router.My setup: 17 wireless devices and 5 wired over a house that is 2-story/3200 sq ft with 200 mbps service.  Modem and router is in the back of the house on the main floor.  So upstairs toward the front of the house really struggled with speeds.  Range was fine but speeds weren't good enough because those are the bedrooms.  My house is newly built in 2015 so the materials in the wall aren't an issue.  Just the distance and plus its much better to have a router upstairs so the signal can filter down rather than downstairs trying to send the signal up.  However, I don't have a choice because of where my only cable line comes in the house (satellite everywhere else).  Over the last year, I've used Airport Extreme, Netgear Nighthawk (all of them) and Onhub.  I've been using the Nighthawk X6 the past few months.  Powerful, but overkill especially when you still have weak spots in the house.  So over the past couple weeks started looking again when I had to start rebooting the router a couple times a week for it to give me my proper speeds.  I had 3 choices: Amplifi, Eero and Google Wifi (when it comes out).  I didn't consider Orbi or Luma.  So I went with Eero.  I was up and running in 10 mins.  Unplug modem, hook up eero.  Power up everything and setup on app.  Done.  I made my SSID and password the same as my other router and all of the other devices immediately connected without issue.So far my speeds have been great all over the house.  Everything loads fast.  As I get further away from the router connected to the modem the speeds drop a little but not by much.  And that is what makes it better than a regular range extender.  You get range AND speed.  They're not hardwired to each other so the speeds I get are excellent considered.  App is great and simple.  Light years ahead of Netgear's Genie app in terms of UI.  Almost everything that's out is ahead of that ;)Couple things I wish it had:1. Additional Ethernet port2. Ability to create different SSIDs for 5GHZ and 2.4GHZ bandsFor someone who wants a lot of advanced options that you would find in a Nighthawk router then you probably won't be pleased with this.  But I really just wanted something I set up, add a guest network and be done.  I don't care about QoS functionality and stuff like that.  So I'll see how this continues to work over the next few weeks and update my review accordingly.  Really with this, price is the major deal breaker for most.  If you can get by that, you should be fine with your purchase.  My review is more like 4.5/5.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROM474CERJ5H7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AGJM390OIKLPZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

Company is going to do very well.One issue:  I live in a 4 floor 6000 square foot house and it's not clear to me that 3 Eeros will be enough.  However, I've only spent 500 bucks so far and every network optimization quote I got was minimum 2k in service and new hardware (the fallacy of commercial grade routers).

"Seewolf",07-Oct-2016,5,"Fantastic system","I spent a lot of time looking at different mesh systems and settled on the eero. I couldn't be happier.I previously had multiple wifi networks in my home to provide full coverage over the three floors. I spent quite a bit of time looking at systems from Ubiquiti and Luma. I purchased an Ubiquiti system that was open box and one of the three access points was giving me trouble so I ended up returning it. The Luma system I had on order was promised for months and never arrived. Thank you to Amazon for helping me get that straightened out. Luckily for me, the delay gave me a chance to read reviews of bot the eero and Luma system and I decided to pay the extra money for the eero system.I'm lucky that my home has an extensive wired network in place so I was able to install all three pieces with wired connections - one on each level of the home. I now have fast and strong connections in every room of my home with no dead spots and no need to change from one network to another. The ability to see every device (wired and wireless) in the house is great. My previous main wireless router was the SkyDog system and I got used to having easy access to turn on and off individual devices and assign them to groups. This is great when the kids are spending too much time online and need a gentle reminder that it is time to put the electronics away (although it isn't really that gentle when there access is suddenly shut off!).I've been very happy with the speed of the wifi. My home currently has 80Mbps broadband. My previous system never came close to this speed but I now routinely see the full 80Mbps through speedtest.net or fast.com (when the wifi traffic on the network is low).A couple of things I would like to see:- The ability to hide the SSID. There is currently no way to turn off the transmission of the network name. I usually keep this hidden, in a dense neighborhood I see this as one extra layer of security.- A filter for web content. This is one thing I loved about the SkyDog system (RIP) and one of the big reasons I initially had a Luma system on order but am so happy with the rest of the system the I'm willing to deal with that. By the way, as of the writing of this review I have a friend who did get the Luma system and has been disappointed so far since (according to them) the filter function is not yet active.Overall, I would recommend this system to anyone who needs a robust mesh network to cover a larger home or small office.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XC84RBWSF1TM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3BOIHIV0BE9AF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

In less than 30 minutes, we had our 3 unit eero system up and running with the fastest speed and strongest signals we have ever had in our two story (2,500+ square feet) home.  No dead spots, buffering issues are gone, no more issues where the kids are complaining because the wifi dropped a signal.  Honestly, we don't really think about our wifi any longer - except for when I happen to see the cute little white square, which, by the way is another plus.  Our last wireless adaptor had so many antennas and continuously blinking lights, our living room was starting to look like the Nassau space center!

The best part for me has been &#34;administering&#34; the network remotely through the iOS app. I have some guests staying at my place, and I didn't have to run over there to set up a guest network for them and change the password. You can also keep tabs on how many devices are on the network at any time.In my case, the wireless router (TP-Link) that I replaced was acceptable. The eeros just penetrate more of the house. I plan to experiment more with placement, as I plan to add at least one wifi security camera to the network. It would be a good feature if the eero smartphone app guided you on placement or told you if, for example, moving one of the devices to a new location helped or hurt.Overall a fantastic experience in my first few days.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3Q498B6XVSNZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2Z6UW1OTQNI8A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"RickP",02-Oct-2016,4,"Achieves the main objective of whole-house wifi, but does have speed degradation and some spotty problems.","I ordered eero with anxiety given the range of reviews, especially the problems many had with connectivity.  My home has been a challenge as it is large with three main sections divided by concrete block.  I have never had wifi throughout the entire house even with the most expensive long-range routers made, coupled with an external access point on a balcony shooting 5ghz across the patio to the outer side of the house into the family room though the sliding windows.I purchased 6 eeros and I now have wifi everywhere in the house, patio and garage.  Six is a lot, and I am unsure if I could do it with 5, but I bought six and did not try fewer. But these devices are not perfect and I have some concerns, even though I am very pleased to have wifi everywhere.Installation was generally easy using the eero iPhone app.  I have an Xfinity Arris TG862 voice/internet modem and placed it in bridge mode prior to eero installation.  Any one of the three eero devices in the box can be the main unit.  I had to restart the Arris router twice (Xfinity has an app to do this from your smartphone) and the main eero twice before the eero connected.  This took about 15 minutes.  Once connected the eero man device has been consistently connected since September 10,2016, except one time when Xfinity had service problems.  So I can confirm Xfinity Arris devices work with eero, but restart them!After the master eero device was connected, I went around the house connecting the other units.  As you connect each unit, the app guides you and it tells you to maintain no more than 40 feet distance from another eero and that they should be line of sight.  So there is a conflict between &#34;marketing&#34; info and the setup because the marketing stuff clearly tells you it is fine placing a unit on one floor and another unit on a floor above or below - which by definition can never be &#34;line of sight&#34; unless you plan to cut holes in floors.  Regardless, I was able to connect all units with little difficulty, though two of the units each had to make two attempts to get a good enough signal.All the units provided service consistently until from 9/10/2016 until 9/29/2016.  On 9/29 the eero unit in the family room, that connects my very new Samsung smart dvd player (used for Netflix and Amazon), would not connect to my Samsung.  I powered off and restarted the Samsung several times and it would not connect.  During this problem, my iPhone did connect however, so it is not all devices that had the problem.  Finally, I powered off that eero and the Samsung.  After the eero came back up, the Samsung connected.  However, this happened three nights in a row after 19 trouble free days.  So there is some stability problem that will cause devices sometimes to get lost to a eero device and it is becoming annoying, but it is only one unit.Now about download speed.  I have the Xfinity extreme 150, which has always obtained over 150mbps for wired devices, 80-90 mbps for wifi for devices off the main router and 50mbps to the one access point I had off that router.  Something is odd about eero's speed. Each day the &#34;master&#34; eero provides the result of a speed test between it and Xfinity.  This has never exceeded 118mbps.  However, I have a laptop connected to the 2nd rj45 port in the main eero, and it gets 160-180mbps using Ookla speedtest.  How can a device connected to the eero achieve more speed than the eero itself gets?As to the speed of the other 5 eero &#34;slave&#34; devices.  I have been unable to get more than 25-40mbps on any slave device.  This is troubling.  Even my access point got 50-80.  A wired laptop gets 180mbps - the eero (master) reports it gets 118mbps - and when that eero master device passes it to the other slave eero units, speed drops to 25-40mbps.  A degradation that great is a problem.  And usually the speed of the slave, during most speed tests begins at about 2-3 mbps for a few seconds and slowly builds to 25.  That latency is also odd.  I talked with eero support before I made this purchase and they told me I could expect a speed loss of &#34;maybe&#34; 20% - clearly they were wrong.  BTW, all devices, wired, master and slave eero wifi consistently get 20-25mbps upload, so no loss for upload in speed tests.The iPhone control app does a great job of naming each eero device and telling you what is connected.  But the app does not provide performance for each eero unit - it simply tells you the connection settings.  And the app does not tell you which wifi device is connected to which eero unit.  Those two missing pieces of information are important and their absence is a problem.Overall the eero mesh network was easy to setup and has established wifi around my home that I have never experienced before.  Also it has been easy to manage.  For that I think the system ranks a 4.  But it comes with some stability mysteries and speed degradation that could be a deal killer for some users.  And that smartphone app needs improvement.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JG2M2NSBOLQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AHBP5DJ2WMUT1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Paul Herz",30-Sep-2016,5,"A blissful solution to terrible Wi-Fi","My family's home is an older home, with thick interior walls made of brick (not just brick façade). What's more, it's two stories and it's long. Ever since Wi-Fi came into popular use, we had a single router in a closet at one end of the house — an old Linksys. Of course, that meant that barely one half of the house had Wi-Fi, but this was still in the days of Wi-Fi extension cards. About five years ago, I scrapped that router and put an Apple Airport Extreme in its place, with an Airport Express in the opposite corner of the house. This worked a lot better, but there was a dreaded dead zone in the middle, which became apparent as we walked through it with our smartphones and our current task slowed to a halt. As soon as I found out about this system, which claims to handle good signal propagation for you (provided you place them at a certain interval with line-of-sight), I was very excited. I bought five for the house, and dotted them throughout, favoring the rooms of family members who had chronically complained about terrible signals and speeds for years. After giving the system a few days to &#34;self-configure,&#34; (eero's secret sauce), everyone had consistently good speeds and reliable signal in every corner of the house, on every device. What's more, we get the speed we're actually paying for with our ISP. Suffice to say I love this product. I don't think the price is that bad when I compare a single unit to an Airport Express, similar in price and size — the eero does more than the Express anyways. One caveat to anyone looking at these is the speed drop that you may experience when your device is connected to an eero node that is several hops away from a wired connection. eero has reduced this problem compared to standard repeaters, but the fact is that you lose speed with each hop — my solution was to hardwire a few eero nodes using Power over Ethernet devices to get ethernet in the middle of the house.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24W2NJDHAT292/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A4V21SG5BIHGO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Matthew Weirath",28-Sep-2016,4,"Expensive, but they can help out in those scenarios where you need extra range and want simplicity","We picked this up on Prime Day, which I thought was a pretty good price.  We have had other extenders before, but with a normal extender it creates a new wifi name so your devices are constantly having to switch depending on where you are, and it causes issues with connected devices like our Sonos. Eero allows you to setup a seamless wifi system that has the same name regardless of where you are at in the condo, and allows all our connected devices to work seamlessly.  Overall I have been very happy, but there are a few things of note: - The wifi signal does get slower (not by a ton) the farther you get away from the 1st unit, so I suggest putting that unit closest to your major bandwidth hogs - We have had a few issues with the devices, which usually resolve themselves, but worse case you have to unplug them and plug them back in.  I will say that generally they work error free. - They have a reasonable level of customization available, but if you have a lot of networking requirements I suggest you check out their site first.  I don't remember what it was that we lost when we ditched our old network, but I remember it was something we felt we could ultimately live with based on the extra convenience we were getting.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RS5UESQ21UR90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1YWW0WD5ETOI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

This is not cheap, but so far, I feel like it was money well spent.  No more networking concerns.Because I bought a 110 year old house, there is no cabling option so everything has to work on wifi.  But because of the walls being plaster and brick, my old system with extenders just wasn't working.  Now I have almost 20 devices connected (from the video doorbell, to all the computers, TV, sound system, lights, etc) without any issue.  I have an internet service that provides 50Mbps download speed.  Next to the connected router i am getting consistent speed of 57Mbps using netflix's speed test.  At the other end of the house where I have a TV connected with an Apple TV, the test is producing 27-29Mbps which is plenty for streaming.  There are areas that drop below that speed, but so far nothing that is terrible.

This causes dead spots when a single router is in the house as the middle stairwell gets in the way. I had tried a range extender with not much luck as although I was in a deadspot with my old router, it would not transition to the extender or when it did I had already lost connection on what I was doing as I walked around. Getting fed up with this, I decided to try the 3 Eero set as it was on sale. My pack of 3 included one lemon that Eero replaced quickly, and their support team was very helpful. I should note that I have 2 of the 3 hard wired in. I am happy to say that since getting them set up, I haven't had a single issue of dead spots. I can walk around my house freely streaming videos or even on skype/FaceTime and I don't have dropped call issues that I had previously. It turned out to be everything that I had hoped for and I am very happy with my purchase.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RX0QZC0B2EKMC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2HDGP9FDAYP9R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

I live in a 3 level colonial and get a great signal with just two Eeros - one on the main level at the right side of the house attached to the Fios modem/router and one in my closet (not even out in the open) in the top floor left side of the house.  I still get a decent signal about 150 feet in front of my house outside.  Such a great product for its ease of set up (10 minutes) and ability to easily name and choose a password for your network.  No more staying with the default network name and password that comes on the Verizon router because who the hell wants to take the time how to figure out how to connect to it to change it?  While I (35 year old guy) set up mine and my in-laws, I am confident that even my mom could figure this out and she still needs tutorial every time she wants to transfer photos from her camera to her PC.

Did a speed test with a Ethernet connection from the middle floor eero to my laptop, get to 250mbps pretty constantly which is great. Bought these to be able to have a continuous wifi signal on the same network ID. It takes a little time for devices to switch over, so I sometimes have to turn airplane mode off/on quickly to get the strongest signal. If you wait a few minutes, it does it usually automatically.Important &#62; if you want to direct wire them, then you CANNOT just connect them all to a switch (unless I got that info wrong).

"Springer",15-Sep-2016,3,"Meh, it's ok I guess. Certainly nothing to write home to mom about.","Background // We have had this product since late February. We purchased it because we moved into a 1960s single story ranch house; i.e. a house that has a long, horizontal living space with rock solid bones (thick plaster walls over a solid wood frame) meaning wifi signal(s) have to travel long spans through thick walls to reach &#34;connected&#34; devices. Well that quickly proved to be a nightmare for standard single router wifi. Enter eero and its promise of whole home connectivity without any degradation in speed. It sounded magical... like when you find a $20 bill in the pocket of a jacket you hadn't worn since last winter. Gosh that's a good feeling. But I digress. You get where I am going with this. The promise of a product the ends spotty wifi?!?!? Heck ya! Even if it seemed to good to be true, we had to take the plunge. And take the plunge we did. We bought the eero 3pk. Below is a recap of our experience thus far:Setup // Everything started off simply enough. We got the app installed and the first eero online. I thought to myself, &#34;well this is gonna be a breeze.&#34; To quote Julia Roberts from Pretty Woman, &#34;Big mistake. HUGE!&#34; Famous last words, indeed. A breeze it was not. Was it as hard as say, performing brain surgery (which I can only assume is difficult)? No. But was it as effortless as say making a PB & J sammich (which we all know is easy and to that point a lot of connected products been able to achieve PB & J ease of execution -- Dropcam comes to top of mind as an example)? Nope. Sure wasn't. The second eero I tried to install couldn't be found even though it was placed well within the specified range. And, then I happened to read the directions a bit more closely... &#34;eeros work best when they can see each other.&#34; Well that seems a bit inconvenient for a &#34;whole home&#34; wifi system considering there are walls and corners and furniture in the way in most homes (I can't even imagine how frustrating this would be if we had multiple floors in our home). And isn't it a little bit narcissistic of the eeros themselves that they just want to look at themselves longingly all day, every day? That's a post for another day I suppose. Anyhow, back to the review, once I got the eeros to see each other from across the room(s) set-up worked reasonably well enough from that point on and I was up and running.Performance // It's been an up and down experience; a bit of a love / hate relationship so far. Some days I love eero. Some days I hate eero. The days I love it -- it does have pretty good whole home coverage for the most part. I can move from room to room and even be outside and still get a wifi signal without having to change networks. That part does work pretty seamlessly. I like being able to see how many devices are online at any given time and the addition of profiles was a nice enhancement to the system. That's kind of where our love ends for eero. So what is it that drives me banana sandwich about eero? Well for starters, it's super finnicky. Move it even half an inch and it stops working. The glowing white light turns a deathly red. Then no matter what room you're in and even if it's not the closest eero to give you the stink eye (i.e. red light of death) it totally messes with your connectivity and out the door goes wireless fidelity. No more Sonos. No more streaming Netflix. No more nothing.  And then comes the whole wifi speed thing... total made-up hoo-ha. Not even close to accurate. Not even close. Ever. This system absolutely does not deliver on its promise to deliver &#34;hyper-fast&#34; wifi across the mesh network. At first I was super pumped to see 100+mbps download speeds from the eero. I began to think of all of the things I could do at once on the Interwebs. So many things, so little time. To say I was giddy like a school girl would be the understatement of the year. Nay the decade. But alas, it was all too good to be true. I opened up some independent speed test apps to see if the speeds jived with what eero was reporting. No way Jose. The independent apps reported that my download speeds were only like 20mbps or 30mbps. That's a far cry from the 100+mbps eero consistently reported. The only time I ever came within 20mbps of what the eero app was reporting was when I was standing directly next to the eero that was hooked up to my modem (it's worth noting that within is the operative word here because even standing at the source I still wasn't getting the reported download speeds the eero app said I was purportedly getting). Wah! Wah! Wah! Sadness ensues. So yeah, I have no idea what sort of funky computations these guys are doing on the backend but I can tell you unequivocally that the speeds reported via my eero app have been erroneous and inflated on all occasions. The whole speed reporting that eero provides feels like a bunch of malarky. Oh well.Conclusion // So in the end, eero is like anything in life. It's both good and bad. What it does well it does reasonably so. What it does poorly it does reasonably so, as well. It certainly isn't anywhere near the best thing since sliced bread -- but I guess what is, really? That said, when you market something as being the best thing since sliced bread it should at least be within spitting distance of that goal and sadly to say that ain't the case here. So 3 stars it gets because if I had to give it a one phrase assessment it would be &#34;Meh, it's ok I guess.&#34;","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLRFTLD8D5C8N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1CKBMP0GRODNV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"Gerald Barber",15-Sep-2016,3,"Outstanding Wifi System marred by inadequate documentation, buggy software, and virtually non-existent technical support","The Good: The Eero is a great wifi extender. I live in a split ranch house which has 3 levels and is approximately 100 feet from end to end on the main level. It's also almost 60 years old and built with material much more impervious to wifi signals than modern construction. I've tried numerous wifi routers and range extenders in an attempt to provide coverage throughout my house and, until Eero, they all failed miserably with large dead zones in various regions of the house that couldn't be eliminated no matter what I tried. Eero is the first system that I found that is able to provide not only wifi coverage, but a strong signal, throughout every room in my house. Why then am I only giving it 1 star?The Bad: Unfortunately, both Eero software and documentation are incredibly buggy. Moreover, even when a more recent version of the software is released, the customer cannot initiate or force their devices to update and instead must wait for the update to be pushed out to their units by the Eero rolling system. In fact, I've been unable to get the update to the latest released version of the software even after contacting technical support to report an issue that I was having. This brings me to the the other major reason for my 1 star rating, customer and/or technical support, or more correctly the near absence of this support. In a little over a week, I've contacted Eero 3 times. The first time, I received a boilerplate response from their website that was totally unresponsive to the issue I raised. Not only did the text on the Eero website not contain the appropriate information that I required to install/setup the Eero system on my network but also my reply to Eero indicating that their boilerplate response didn't address the question that I specifically asked was completely ignored with no further answer or information provided. It was only through trial and error that I was able to figure out the steps that I needed to take to setup the Eero system. After completing the initial setup, I needed to open some ports on the Eero for forwarding of specific Internet communication to other devices running on my system. I soon discovered that this also didn't work as described. I again contacted Eero support, only to be told that their system indicated that the ports I was attempting to forward were indeed open. Still I could not get external communication to work. Ultimately, I discovered that, due to a bug in their software, even if your device only requires/uses TCP communication, you have to open both the TCP and UDP protocols on the port before Eero with correctly forward the communication to the appropriate device. I recontacted Eero support and was told that they're &#34;aware of this issue.&#34; Finally, I noticed that, concurrent with replace my router with Eero, my network developed terrible latency issues in communication between local devices. Devices that had near instantaneous response with the old router were now taking 2 to 6 seconds to respond and this delay was causing both software and hardware to fail. I again contacted technical support. It took 2 days to get a response, which was to escalate the issue. It took another 2 days before I heard for the escalation agent and this response just asked for more specifics on my system, which I immediately sent. Now 6 days after I originally reported the problem and 4 days after it was supposedly escalated, I'm still waiting on a response that would actually help me resolve the problem.In summary, if it happens to work with your network out of the box, Eero is an outstanding wifi system. However, you're on your own if it doesn't. The document is inadequate, the software is buggy, and technical support is virtually non-existent. As a result, I cannot recommend this system for non-IT professionals.Edit: 02/08/2017 - Eero now allows the user to initiate a manual update instead of waiting for the update to be rolled out to the device.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3L3UGW7SIRHVJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1S8CB2RSVMM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Rcat274",12-Sep-2016,5,"the eeros have to be ""within sight"" of each other for best connectivity to the other eeros in the system","I ordered this product because I was dissatisfied with the wi-fi situation in my home. My home has ethernet that runs through the walls so two eeros had a physical connection through an ethernet cable while one eero had to do connect wirelessly.Having a physical connection to the eero greatly enhances download and upload speeds around the home. Two eeros were placed upstairs and then one eero downstairs. It is slightly true that more or less, the eeros have to be &#34;within sight&#34; of each other for best connectivity to the other eeros in the system. Otherwise you will be prompted saying the connectivity strength is not as strong as it could be.This product was purchased because we have several chomecasts and mobile devices throughout my home. Now no need to switch to different wi-fi networks to connect to the chromecast that we need. No complaints. The physical size of the eero is much smaller than I anticipated. Overall great product.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R25BENELEKM0P1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A271PHWDCLNZ5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"nycebo",12-Sep-2016,3,"Eero vs Luma surprise result","I've been wanting an Eero for a long time, ever since it was first announced. The idea of having a mesh network just sounded so appealing. By the time that I finally got around to buying one, a couple of competitors had popped up. The most promising of them is the Luma. So, I actually bought both mesh routers and will proceed to review and compare them here (a copy of this review will be posted on both the Luma and the EERO product pages).DESIGNThe Eero hardware is really awesome. As others have mentioned, it looks like something that Apple would design. Very glossy white and sleek looking. The routers are small squares that lie flat and have power and network cables coming out the back. There's also a USB, presumably for NSCs or printers. Eero also gave extra thought to maximizing radio antenna efficiency: the tops of the routers are modestly rounded to prevent users from putting glasses or other items on top of them (and thus obstructing strong signal).The Luma hardware is pretty nice also. Actually, the honeycomb is pretty handsome on a bookshelf and I like that it comes in different colors. BUT, and this is a big bug, the Luma is meant to stand on edge. And, when the power and network cables are plugged in, it's unsteady. This doesn't matter too much if your first router is in the fiber closet, but it'll fall over somewhat often out in the open and look the eyesore.Edge to Eero.SETUPI have Verizon FIOS fiber running at my home. Setup was pretty easy as I just plugged one end of a network RJ-45 cable into the ONT and then the other end directly into the &#34;first&#34; router. Luma apparently also allows for ethernet backhaul, but Eero doesn't at present. Regardlees, I don't use that feature so it's not relevent to me. Moreover, I doubt most buyers of this product will use it either. Anyway...The Luma was set up first. Things went pretty smoothly. I downloaded the app from Android Play store and created an account with username and password. Remember to log into your old router and release the IP address for your ISP. Then I just followed the instructions on the app: powered down the old router, powered down the ONT (aka modem), plugged the network cable into the ONT and the Luma hub, and then plugged them both in. The Luma app on my Google Nexus 6P found the hub immediately, named it and asked me to sit patiently while it registered on the network. Sadly, that never happened. I tried one more time...no go. A quick search online revealed that some Android devices have difficulty. So, I tried setup with my Google Nexus 9 tablet and voila! It registered and I had wireless network. For the next two hubs, I used an old iPhone and things worked very smoothly also. So, perhaps it just didn't like my Nexus 6P. Small bug but no harm done.The Eero set up was also smooth....after I figured out how to release my IP address on the Luma (see below). Basically, I had to power down the ONT and wait a couple hours. Once I did, setup with my Nexus 6P was quick this time round. Again, I downloaded the Eero app and created an account by entering my telephone number and then entering a 6 digit SMS code. The Eero hub was named, registered and had live internet. Good to go.I'll call this a tie despite the Nexus 6P hiccup with Luma. But if you have a Nexus 6P and want to use a Luma, be prepared to need to try a different device for setup. If you're a stickler, edge to Eero.THE APP INTERFACERight off the bat, both Eero and Luma apps are sparse. If you're used to configuring a wireless router in the past,  you will be unpleasantly surprised by the absence of desired features, including dynamic DNS, QoS, IP release, etc. However, I recognize that these devices are supposed to be family friendly and that they are. Following the instructions in both apps is super easy and very efficiently and quickly gets the first wifi puck up and running. NOTE: I must emphasize that the Verizon FIOS ONT needs to release the IP address in order to switch routers. If you don't release it, then you need to sit around for 2 hours with it powered down until does so automatically. This shouldn't affect most users who just buy either the Luma or the Eero. But, if you are planning on testing a couple devices, it's wise to remember.Anyway, at this point, both apps look very similar and clean with their router status view, upload and download speeds and devices attached tab. Furthermore, they let you add new routers to the mesh network easily, name them (although Eero allows for custom names), reserve IP addresses (in advanced settings menus), enable port forwarding, assign wireless devices to a user profile, UPnP, etc. Here's where they differ:The Eero app allows devices to be nicknamed (a super nice feature), allows for a custom DHCP, and allows DNS config if you want to use Google or OpenDNS or whomever.The Luma can't do any of those at present. However, it does allow for IGMP Snooping to be enabled or disabled. Luma also offers a rating filter for all or specified users. I don't know what the movie-like ratings mean but it would seem handy if I had young kids to whom I wanted to restrict content.In the end, they are both pretty similar. If I had to give one an edge, it would be the Eero simply because it allows nicknames for device connections. I dig that.Minor edge to Eero.SIGNALOkay, a lot of words to get to the part that matters most. How is the signal? Alas, this is really hard to quantify. Basically, I walked around all of the rooms in my home with the Wifi Analyzer app and took readings. On average, the Eero was about 2-5 db better than the Luma in each room. Having read some reviews online, perhaps it has to do with the extra 5Ghz antenna. Who knows? But, it was a pretty minor discrepancy and may have had more to do with how the hubs hand off the connection to one another (or don't) than actually signal strength. I will say this, BOTH Eero and Luma very capably covered all corners and rooms of my home. That alone is a tremendous victory compared to my sad history with range extenders that just never satisfied us at all.So, minor edge to Eero but very satisfactory marks to both.THROUGHPUTAfter writing the above, a big surprise here. No bones about it but the Luma just clobbered the Eero. I have no explanation for this, especially after Eero's signal advantage. Basically, my devices would connect to the Eero hubs admirably and all looked well, achieving 120% of my Verizon FIOS bandwidth. But, after an hour or so, throughput would just plummet to about 10-30%. Badly. It made me crazy. Browsing was bad. Streaming was very difficult. My wife (who doesn't care about these tests at all) would complain and ask what I was doing to the network. I ensured that I was running the latest version but it didn't seem to resolve anything. I power-cycled everything. No success.The Luma, on the other hand, functioned well. It would test at 100-120% of my FIOS bandwidth and almost always stay there, even if I ventured to far corners of the apartment. It made streaming on multiple devices, browsing, downloading, and music MUCH nicer than I have ever had in the past. And, the wife didn't complain. All is not rosy though. With some music sources, Luma needs a little attention. Sonos (Pandora and TuneIn Radio) ran into buffering pauses every so often. I'm hopeful that they can resolve this soon.So, I don't have a good answer for why this was the case...especially since a lot of other users have raved about Eero. Perhaps the signal just doesn't steer my devices to the faster frequency connection. Candidly, even the 2.4GHz shouldn't have an issue. It was just curious.Edge to Luma. But remember that you might not have this experience and I wasn’t going to waste more than a weekend trying to nail down the issue.PRICEBecause of the intro pricing for pre-ordering the Luma, it was $250 cheaper for me than the Eero. These devices are already pricey compared to traditional routers so it matters.Edge to Luma.FINAL RESULTSHere's the rub, since Luma cost much less and functioned better, I just ended up keeping it. Yes, the little hexagons aren't as aesthetically pleasing but I can't have complaints about video quality on Netflix and Amazon Prime. Since we don't have cable, HD streaming is very important. So, while others have had good success with Eero, I just can't affirm their experiences. Unless you have extensive streaming requirements or network throughput needs, I think that Luma should suffice nicely. And for the price, it's a no brainer...even if it is only $100 less than the Eero now.But, and it's a big but: both manufacturers really need to keep stepping it up in development. The apps and features are way too vanilla at present. Good signal and performance will only get you so far with more advanced users.EERO (3 stars)LUMA (4 stars)","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LN2K8771FZ7B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1KPFZCS71QKW5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
"Shawn H.",12-Sep-2016,5,"Finally a Quality Product Worth Buying","Let me start by saying that I normally don't write many reviews on products, nor do I put my name on them.  However, this is one that I will make an exception for.  I absolutely love the eero systems that I have bought.  And just so you know, I went with the 2 pack to get started.You really can't ask for a more simple setup process.  Simply plug your first eero device into your modem/router and then follow the steps on your mobile app.  Adding a second eero was even easier.In case this helps you with your decision to by, the current house these 2 devices are covering is around 2500 sq. ft and 2 story.  I have one eero upstairs in the media room and one downstairs in the living room.  These 2 cover the entire house with no issue and I can even get coverage out into the front and back yards.I've been in IT for many years and appreciate being able to just set eero up and then forget about it.  Occasionally I'll receive an email saying my devices have been updated to improve security and performance.  Thank you for that!  Last thing I want after working a full day is to come home and have to worry about updating firmware on my wireless devices.If you are a huge techie and want every single wireless or network option/feature to play around with then this may not be the device you are looking for.  But if you are looking for a stable, quality product that does everything it needs and then some, this is a great purchase!

I work from home so I VPN all the time, dedicated connection. Because of my work, I chose to keep my Netgear equipment, which is made of X8 and a R7000 extender plus AC outlet extender, too. I installed both, eeros and left my original Netgear install to see how it worked. As usual, my Netgear continued to deliver, I run 105 Mbps which translates into 70-90 Mbps wireless but with the eeros was a constant 20 Mbps at the most, except standing next to the eero plugged to the modem. I followed recommended setting and unplugged my Netgear router and tested again, without success, eero speed remained 20 Mbps. Let me be clear, eero is a good solution for someone who has not a minimal idea how to plug a router and needs a wifi setup, which most ISP companies will help you install anyways; but to claim hyper speeds, I think it's not the right claim at least not in my home.

We have a 2-story home and my wife has her office in our detached garage. Getting good wifi coverage has been impossible. To try to improve things, I originally purchased a typical range extender. That helped... but it was inconsistent - would sometimes provide a great signal on our second floor and in the garage, but often not - which might have been more frustrating than not having it at all. I was always rebooting it to try to get it to work.I bought the Eero system out of desperation. Didn't want to have to go to a wired system, but didn't have much hope that it would actually do the job. I figured with my Prime membership and Amazon's return policy, I didn't have much to lose. I ordered 4 just to make sure I'd have adequate coverage in our home.From the moment I plugged them in, things just worked. It was like magic. I didn't want to believe it at first - I kept our other router pumping out it's signal thinking that the Eero network would fail at any moment. It didn't. Ever.

At other times, I would have to take extra steps to get things to connect with WiFi at all. After installing the eero access points, I don't even have to think about WiFi. Another feature that is a positive is how the system updates. It just happens and you get notified. No downloading firmware and rebooting. It's not that hard to update firmware on an access point, but it's much nicer to know that the system is just taking care of that and then letting you know.

I tried Netgear and nothing improved the situation. My son told me to check out EERO. This company, their products are game changing. It is easy to install, app works brilliantly, no more dead spots, no TV issues. We have a guesthouse and were told by AT&T we needed to add service and they said no way to  get WiFi; with eero we have super WiFi. I know this is a pricey product but it works. Their support is awesome (though I only called with questions before I purchased - haven't needed any support post purchase). The 'pods' only need and electric outlet (they come with a nice length cord). The app lets you know if they are properly placed for best results. EERO is a GREAT product! (and a great company)30-DAY UPDATE - eero still works like a champion. It has solved our dead spot or slow speed areas (only issue remains is AT&T Gigapower still goes out for a couple minutes at a time several times a week and if you are live streaming it is a pain BUT eero gives the TV very high download speed).

The modem has to be upstairs, which makes the reception in the downstairs bedrooms difficult to impossible.  I purchased a signal extender, which worked for a while, but never well or consistently.  When I read about eero, I was very interested.  True to the review, it was VERY easy to set up, with one exception.  It took me a while to figure out the best way to get my Sonos working again.  My wife is far more into Sonos than she is exceptional WiFi coverage, so she quickly declared it a bust.  However, with a little bit of research, I very quickly solved that problem and we now have spotless and fast WiFi in areas where we had no WiFi before. I also have younger kids who love to log back in when it's lights out...eero allows me to schedule their WiFi access, so I can shut them down at night.

I was reminded of this again yesterday when I set up a Belkin wifi in my daughter's dorm room (I had to go with one of the access points &#34;recommended&#34; by the university).When I got home from taking my daughter back to school yesterday, the electricity went out at our house, reminding me of another advantage of the eero. In the past, with the Airport Time Capsule, the electricity would go out. When it came back, I would have to go into my office and restart components in the right order to get them to come back up. This often took 30 minutes or so. Not yesterday. When the system went down, I received an email. When it came back up, it took about 3 minutes or so, but it all reset itself so that we were back on line.I didn't like spending $500 to replace the Airport, but there is no question that this system is the best.

"mikemahaff",06-Sep-2016,5,"Finally","Like everyone who has submitted a review about eero, we could never get consistent, high speed wifi throughout our house. Speeds were half what we could get by using Ethernet, and that was on a good day. At least twice a week we would have to reboot to get a signal. Finally, wifi would not extend throughout our house which meant no TV streaming in our family room (too far from our modem/router). With eero all of that is now a distant nightmare. Our internet speeds through wifi are consistent and the same as Ethernet speed; no more rebooting; and, finally, we are streaming movies with virtually no buffering. That alone gives eero 5 stars and I haven't even mentioned their fantastic support team. Once I knew I could stream I purchased a smart tv for my office in my home where there is no wiring for a satellite box. For some reason the TV could not connect with my eero network. I contacted support and Dave was immediately on it. He had me do some things but most of the techno hocus pocus was done at eero headquarters. In no time, my wifi and my tv were connected and I'm now watching sports while I work.

"Froggy",02-Sep-2016,2,"$500 and performs worse than a $50 range extender.","I purchased an Eero 3 pack in hopes of improving the Wi-Fi situation of my home. I had recently bought a Ring Wi-Fi doorbell, and the signal at my front door wasn't great, resulting in problems with the video feed from the doorbell. I tried some moving my router, and buying some different extenders and experimenting with what will work best. After some playing around, at best I was still only able to get results that were &#34;ok&#34; at the doorbell, but nothing fantastic.I've previously heard about the Eero, but at $500 it was going to be a last resort. I bit the bullet and gave them a try, and was awfully disappointed with the results. The setup in theory was supposed to be simple, and I assume it would be simple if you have one of the few smartphones that are compatible with their App, but I didn't. I ended up buying a used Nexus tablet just for this, and spent a few hours just trying to get the Eero app installed and launched. Why couldn't I just use a browser like every other piece of consumer networking equipment ever? Once I finally got the app to launch, I couldn't even configure the Eeros as I lacked a data connection, so I needed to use my neighbor's Wi-Fi just to set things up.It was smooth sailing after the first unit, the next two pretty much configure themselves. That was about all that went well.The speeds were absolutely terrible. With my old setup of being connected via Wi-Fi AC to my router I would be able to average a 400 megabit transfer speed from my server, and when connected to my range extender it would still easily do 200 megabit, more than enough for streaming high quality videos. Doing the exact same tests on Eeros, I never saw faster than 20 megabit. Streaming video with a 30-megabit bitrate wouldn't work, as it would be constantly buffering. Countless hours troubleshooting didn't help, the only solution was to plug in my old router and switch over to that when I wanted to watch something.I also had a weird issue which I could never explain, whenever I shut down my desktop (which was connected by Ethernet directly into my modem, not connected to the Eeros at all), the entire Eero network would go down. The second I fire up the desktop, I'd have Wi-Fi again.There is next to no configuring the Eero, the options are very stripped down and over simplified. No QoS, can’t use different SSIDs for 2.4 and 5ghz, no way to monitor what device is doing what or how much bandwidth is in use or by what. It is a router for stupid people, not people that want to know what is going on in the world.The coverage the Eeros provide is fantastic, it blanketed my house. While I didn’t have any dead spots before, coverage was significantly improved upon. Unfortunately, that coverage didn’t mean much, as the performance was terrible.Back to my original issue with the doorbell, the Eero didn’t help. I had great signal near the doorbell now, but due to the performance issues of the Eeros, video quality still suffered and frequently dropped out entirely. I eventually resolved the issue by disconnecting the Eero’s, and using a Netgear power line networking based Wi-Fi extender. Now the doorbell streams high quality video without issue, at about a tenth of the price of the Eero system.There is a saying that you get what you pay for, this is one of the few times that it doesn't apply","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R381EWGGILFT4F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A15NRXEB0AC65J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

It definitely increased my available speed - the biggest difference was it shortened the 'delay' from 167 to 9!

"D. Bacon",31-Aug-2016,5,"Works well with existing ethernet network","When we remodeled our 1944 two-story house with basement, we ran Ethernet cable from the cable modem in the basement to every room in the house.  This is great for wired devices like a desktop computer, printer, TiVo, Roku or Xbox, but so many things are wireless now.  The wired network let us put our wireless router in a fairly central location in the living room, but WiFi speeds dropped to half of wired speeds in my husband's basement office and the kitchen, and disappeared completely in my son's bedroom and husband's garage workshop.  Eero has been the perfect solution.  I got the three pack and placed each one on a different floor, zig-zagging horizontally across the house.  I plugged each Eero into an Ethernet jack, so they talk to each other through my existing wired network.  My son now has an Eero in his room which also improved the signal in the kitchen, and the Eero in the basement has improved the signal for my husband in his office and also his garage workshop.  We now can get full 60 mbps WiFi speeds anywhere in the house.  Everything works, including iPhones, Apple/Windows/Linux laptops and tablets, WeeMo switch, Kindle, Aria Scale, AmbientWeather Station, as well as the wired devices I mentioned earlier.  The fact that Eero is actively updating the router software gives me hope that this router will be resistant to malware attacks.  It was expensive, but I think the price was reasonable for three routers that work seamlessly together, allowing your devices to roam between the different access points.  Three Eeros are the perfect number for our 3000 square foot house.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11GASH934NQTT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1RB25H2OU6JQL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Omar Shahine",29-Aug-2016,5,"Eero vs Luma","On paper, these two companies are similar. They are startups that are well funded, and have recently launched devices that are about the size of an Apple TV or an Apple Airport Express. You typically buy a pack of 3, plugging one into your modem and the others to ethernet or leave alone and they will create a wireless mesh network. eero has been the market longer than luma.If you have Sonos, then you are already familiar with mesh networks. Like Sonos, these devices can talk to each other via wireless, as long as each one can &#34;see&#34; the other. From there they re-distribute the wifi signal creating a constant amount of coverage.These devices are also incredibly easy to setup and manage (in theory). You do everything from your phone app. And you can manage your network from anywhere. They are cloud powered routers. eero has written a lot about their cloud operations. Impressive.However, that is where the comparisons end. I have used both devices now and can weigh in on which one is better. I got an eero for my father and set that up in May. I also got a Luma for myself, and waited a few months longer to get that. Then I also got an eero for myself after some disappointing results with the luma.Below is my experience with both.UnboxingThe clear winner here is eero. The simple explanation is that the eero is like unboxing an Apple Product. The box is easy to open, the materials are top notch (glossy white plastic and soft touch rubber). The charger and finishes are exactly what you would get from an Apple Product.The Luma on the other hand feels cheap. The power plug is gray, but exactly like any other electronic product. The device box is cheap plastic feeling. For many people this device will be visible in their home (like it is for my parents) and so I think this matters.Oh, almost forgot. It was comical hard to actually open the luma box. No product should be hard to get out.Winner: eeroSetupTo set up each device, you install their iOS app, then plug in the first device and go through the setup process.The eero device completed setup in under 10 seconds. It was what I expected, so I didn't think much of it.The luma device took a very long time to setup and failed multiple times. This repeated with each device I set up. It was a bit baffling to be honest.Once the devices are set up, you are now ready to add more devices.Winner: eeroSoftware updatesBoth devices manage software updates automatically. With the eero you can see what version you have. The software updates automatically overnight, and in the latest app update they added a mode where you can force an update. You can even see release notes here.The luma does not show you any information about what version of the software it's running and there is no way to update, or see release notes or anything.It's worth noting, that when I was setting up my father's eero devices, the software updates never came down. I called eero and talked to a live person and he was pretty amazing at getting it resolved. It took a few calls and emails and they determined that one of the devices was faulty and they overnight shipped a replacement the next day. I didn't have a chance to work with luma on anything like that, but the experience with eero was very impressive.Winner: eeroPhone AppAs I mentioned you do everything from the phone app. In the case of the eero I can manage my network and my Dad's from the same app. When I next visit my sister, I plan to get her setup with eero as well and I'm guessing she will need at least 5 devices.In each phone app you can do things like manage your wifi setup and password, choose a guest network (and share the network name and password), see all the connected devices and also create profiles for each person in the house and do some basic parental controls.Right now, I think the luma app has the edge because it has a visual map of your wifi coverage which I find handy. Winner: lumaParental ControlsBoth apps offer basic parental controls. The reason I wanted to get the luma was that they had said they would offer very deep parental controls. In that time eero added parental controls and luma still hasn't delivered on what they said they would offer.Here is the deal. They are both limited at this right now. The best parental control device (and generally useful network management device) is the Circle with Disney. I will review this soon, but I can tell you right now that it's 5 star.Circle, the most advanced parental control deviceWinner: tieReliability and PerformanceThese are highly complex devices making your life simple and easy. The first few months for eero were bumpy and that's also true for luma. Amazon Reviewers rate the eero far higher than luma (4.4 star for eero vs 2.9 stars for luma). There are some very troubling issues with luma that will be resolved with time. For one thing, the Amazon rating trajectory for them is rather bad. They will need to fix this.The biggest issue I immediately ran into with luma was that every few hours, my iPhone, PC, iPad would spin for a few seconds before completing a task such as loading a web page.I though maybe that was just me.... but no, my wife and kids noticed it to. I did some light trouble shooting turning parental controls off and so on (this is before we had the Circle). I also did a lot of speed tests. I have 120 Mbps service from Comcast and with the Luma not once did I ever see sustained performance hard wired. The eero however has constantly been clocking in at my full bandwidth.In the end, my tolerance for this stuff is super low. Internet needs to work always and work well. I returned the luma after 2 days and my life with the eero has been glorious.Winner: eeroCostThe luma is cheaper. This is by design as eero was the first to market and has a lot of mindshare. To get people to pay attention, I believe luma undercut them (the 3 pack is $100 cheaper from luma).However, this is an important investment for your house. I would not recommend getting the luma due to its lower cost. That $100 could be a big deal in the long run.When purchasing I'd recommend getting the 3 pack as each device is priced at $166 vs $199 individuals. There is also a 2 pack. I got one 3 and one 2 pack.Winner: lumaFinal ThoughtsIt's really exciting to  me that wifi is entering a new era. Surround wifi will solve dead spot and coverage issues for so many families.I fully expect the luma to resolve a number of the problems I identified. However, at this time the eero has been in the market longer, and is the clear leader.I am super happy with my setup. I now have 5 eero devices in my house, they are all hard wired except for the one. I have replaced everything else powering wifi in the house and it's glorious. I highly recommend getting eeros.Winner: eero","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HLY5E01VZYLO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A1M841R4VB4AVY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Srinivasa",29-Aug-2016,5,"Expensive but worth every penny","My home is split over 3 levels. I have a 300 mbps connection which I could never receive reliably or at any significant speed down in the basement. After trying out numerous alternatives (routers, access points, extenders, and power line adapters), I stumbled on eero. I now have 4 of them spread over the house and get the expected 300 mbps from anywhere the house. An expensive proposition at $600 for 4 units -- but boy -- has it been worth it !!The installation process is super slick and I can see that this will be how setup applications will be in the future -- with a fancy app that guides you at every step and knows what you are doing. A couple of weeks or so after I had installed the eero units, I decided to turn off the WIFI on the router provided by the cable company. This actually improved the performance and reliability of the entire eero system and I suggest everyone do this.One odd thing that I have noticed is that if the internet connection goes down, the eero that is connected to the router gets very hot. I mean really HOT -- and it may be something the eero folks need to worry about -- perhaps some venting slits in the side or the top of the unit may be required to prevent damage to the unit if the internet connection goes down for extended periods of time.Apart from this observation regarding an edge condition -- I think the eero is a game changer and a truly amazing product.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RP9DCGNGHG0JU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2CYB8863WH636/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

The nice aesthetics is a plus: you can place the eero stations in plain sight without your wife complaining about some ugly piece of technology being out in the open like the Linksys line of devices.  I did run into a problem where my cable modem (Arris SB6183) firmware caused conflicts with the eero (which is documented on their web site).  My ISP was unable/unwilling to update the firmware, so I had to upgrade my modem (SB6190) and now all is well.  It is a pricey system, but well worth it when considering the setup ease and reliability of the system.  I haven't had to restart my eeros like I had to with other routers.

I found a series of issues which resulted in a return.– While it did create a mesh network, each 'hop' cuts the download speed in half. If you pay for 150 Mb down, and you are at the end opposite side of the house, expect to get at most 1/2 your speed, possibly 1/4 or less.– Intermittent speeds, even when standing directly in front of the main unit– These units also got very hot– My three year old Apple Airport Extreme (Gen 6 / A1521, current version) outperform eeros in all respects. In fact, after fiddling with placement and tech support calls and finally returning the eeros, I revisited my Extremes and named the four SSIDs the same name – it roams seamlessly now.– It's odd that you need to provide both your cell phone and email address to set these units up– I added a star, because out of the box, if you get this for grandma, they do seem to blanket a house with coverage, it's just slow.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29VBAQU246QY4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AS8MGXJC8538E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

It installed fine but I was very disappointed with their lack of features on launch and their promises to deliver their features must have been talking about later generations of software.  A call to support was pleasant however their roadmap to include the features (like DNS customization) wasn't on their roadmap yet.  Performance was very painful and since they don't string / daisy chain to each other (each device has to connect back to the main hub device) I was limited in my reach.Then I tried Uniquiti wifi.  I used them in a corporate settings and they are simple screaming APs however I wasn't able to run a hardwire eathernet cable to each one so I had to return them.I finally spent the extra $ to go with Eero and I was so impressed.

The promised ease of use was even better","UPDATE:  I reached out to the CEO to let him know about the experience and he said that a new cable/modem would solve the problem.  He offered to send one for free.  I installed it and, lo and behold, it worked!  Would have been nice to get there faster but they had a nice save at the end and did the right thing.-----------------------------------I was so excited about this product when I read about it.  We just moved to a house that needed more coverage and a mesh network seemed perfect.  The promised ease of use was even better.I have had this for two months.  First I set it up as a node off the main network, and I had a lot of problems with speed when the Eero wasn't the router.  I then switched it to be the router for my entire network, at which point the wireless nodes started interfering with the Sonos system.  This was discovered after weeks of interactions with customer service.  The result was that download times would drop to 1-2 mbs on the wireless network (I get 300mbs normally).  When I disabled all my Sonos units, this solved the problem.  Then the two Roku units started having issues.  Again, after more weeks with customer service, I'm at a point where Netflix won't work on any device (including a TV without a Roku), none of the Rokus will work wirelessly, and I have continuous problems with sites in a wired format.I switched back to my Airport Extreme for my router and all problems solved.  But now am having speed issues again using the Eeros just as wireless access points.  So I will switch back to my older airport expresses.I have literally spent months interacting with customer service.  Changing my DNS settings.  Resetting every possible setting on the Eeros.  Dedicating ports.  Disabling everything else on my network.  I asked to send the product back because as far as I'm concerned, it's defective.  They then told me that since I bought it on Amazon, and it is past 30 days, nothing they can do.In the future...don't try to fix it...just send it back.  Before 30 days are up!

Great community on Reddit.  Speed test results in the App are usually way off, compared to Ookla.  I had been waiting on a Luma system but with their delays, then I read that Eero has an update with Parental controls, so I ordered.  When I think parental control for an Internet related system, I think of content filtering.  Eero's parental controls are about schedules for individual devices, not content filtering.  If it did content filtering, I'd probably give it 5 stars, assuming it was as good as the quality they have put into everything else.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TDOHJYSJ30JJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AD366LGL88Y7W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Peter C. Neuman",24-Aug-2016,5,"This product is fantastic and requires very little knowledge of networking as it ...","As a network engineer and private network consultant I am occasionally asked to set up or upgrade home networks for employees at the executive level of the companies I support. This purchase was for a very large home in Westchester, New York. A castle actually which is primarily made of solid stone and very irregularly shaped.  Multiple floors and upwards of 20K + square feet.  The system they had, consisted of several apple airport extremes and expresses and they were constantly having issues with the in-home wifi.  Signal drop outs, dead spots etc..  I had recently purchased an eero kit for a much smaller home and had been impressed with the simplicity of the setup and the performance so I decided to implement it in this castle.  It took three kits of which we used 8 out of the 9 eeros.  We removed every apple product from the network and replaced them with an eero.  In some spots, we actually didn't need to place an eero unit where there had been an apple product because the signal coming from the other erros was covering the area more than sufficiently.  By the time it was over, my client was thrilled not only with the throughput speeds in all areas of the castle, but also the setup process.  He installed the app on his phone and tablet and was loving the process of adding the erros to the network.  This product is fantastic and requires very little knowledge of networking as it pretty much configures itself.  From an IT perspective, I like the ability to dive in a little to the configuration and advanced settings options where you can manage each erro with specific settings to accommodate each rooms specifications.  About 5 of the erros we installed were hard wired to the master switch and the other 3 were picking up the wifi signal and extending it.  All without issues, errors or signal irregularity.  If you have a home or small business, look no further.  Buy this, install it, have fun while doing it, and kiss your wifi issues goodbye.

Pope",23-Aug-2016,5,"Awesome system, easy to setup and works as advertised!","After much debate due to the higher cost of this system, I ordered the Home Wifi system and set it up yesterday in my home.  First step though was to replace my current Xfinitiy cable modem/router with just a cable modem so as to remove any potential conflict with operating the new system behind the old router. (I had read that Arris modem / wifi routers don't work well with the router portion turned off).  I installed the new modem, called Xfinity (Comcast), registered the new modem and plugged the first Eero in.  Step 1: download the software onto my iphone.  Step 2, followed the prompts.  Step 3, I installed 3 eeros into my home in a matter of 10 minutes and instantly the wifi in the house was improved.  All the dead zones I had (even with access points setup) were gone, and my upload/download speeds are what they've been advertised.  This is the simplest wifi router system i've ever setup and their claims of no more buffering, no more dead zones...absolutely true.

My download speed of iPhone increased 4 times from 24 bps to close to 100 bps consistently (after 24 hrs, the effect is even more prominent). My corner bedroom which used a slow PC got a 3 times boost in download speed. I have tried two other systems before (Azeus and extenders), but this system is the only one you will ever need.

If you have a big house, just do it.","My 3 eeros replaced a custom setup using DD-WRT flashed into a Buffalo router and a bridged Apple router in a large house.  Eero was easiest setup ever. The first day it was somewhat slow, as measured by a couple of test apps running in an iPad Pro. But eeros updated their firmware overnight and the system became progressively faster. Since 3rd day, by far the fastest and most complete coverage I've ever had in the house. So far we've experienced no problems, even with as many as 15 devices connected and 3 streaming simultaneously. Both my iPad Pro and wired PCs regularly report 80 - 90 megabit/sec downloads over a Comcast cable in a somewhat rural location. It's actually a little hard to believe. We have had one extended power failure, and the eero network brought itself back online normally when power was restored.Eeros do not yet support IPv6, although it is promised as &#34;coming soon&#34;. I'd like to add one more eero to improve coverage in one corner of the lower level of the house (although the existing setup does reach there). However, the per-unit cost of a single additional eero is much higher than the per-unit cost of my set of three.

Setup was a breeze and I was up and running in less then 5 minutes with the first eero. The remaining 2 were strategically placed in my house for the best coverage in less than 10 minutes. These offer better more reliable coverage inside and outside of my house than I've ever gotten with any other combination of router with range extenders. These are easy to set up with the instructions and there has not been a single dropped signal like i would get with my router. I haven't had to unplug or restart anything. I have an Iphone and the app you need to set the eero up is easy to use and intuitive. It also has a speed test in the app so you can see what you current upload and download speeds are. I haven't tested this against anything so I can't speak to it's accuracy. I use a switch in my office to connect my computers and peripherals to the network. People complain about the cost and I agree they are pricey but after you spend money on a good router and research the numerous other options for extending coverage you could get to the same cost very easy. You don't have the multitude of options you get with a router for setting up your network but I feel most of those are overkill for the average user.

After that point it was all downhill. Could not get any of the other Eero's to connect to the main hub. Literally got to the point that one was less than 10 feet away in plain sight... Nothing! Sorry for $499 it's going right back where it came from.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R276IT6XR1UMIL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A12MOWJ7RDPAPD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"P. K.",19-Aug-2016,4,"Excellent product, a little pricey, and customer support is AWOL but excellent nonetheless","Ok, I've had these in place for a few months now. Long enough to have an opinion.First of all, they are very &#34;Appleish&#34; in the design and appearance. Even the packaging. It is quite nice. Assuming you have an iphone or ipad to run the app on, the setup is very simple and nearly foolproof. To be fair, I didn't try the Android app but based on other reviews, it appears that the ios app is more refined. They have simplified the product setup (perhaps too much?) and made it a breeze for anyone, even without technical knowledge, to get these up and running quickly and painlessly.Once the 3 APs are up and connected to each other, &#34;it just works&#34;. Bravo! I can attest that these absolutely fixed WiFi dead spots and weak signals throughout my house. I replaced an Asus 802.11ac router/AP with these and the difference has been fantastic. Yes, yes... I know, some of you are screaming about &#34;if you know how to configure.. blah blah blah&#34;. I know how to configure it - I've got many many years and all the silly certificates and whatnot. That isn't the issue.The app has a really nice indicator with status and how many devices are connected. One very nice addition is the speed test. You &#34;pull down&#34; the screen and it runs a speed test and displays the results right in the app. Nice touch. I also like that I can create and share a guest network in seconds with the app. Very nice. The lack of physical ports on the devices isn't that big a deal. A cheap switch plugged into one of those solves that problem forever.Now for the not so great...Because this is simplified for anyone to get it up and running and even manage it, it lacks some advanced features or tweaks. I have some wireless devices that are a little bit finicky. A thermostat for example works like a champ on 2.4 GHz but has erratic connectivity on 5. Don't know why, it just does. The app would benefit from an &#34;expert mode&#34; or something like that where I could define those things. I also would like to have the option to define the channel being used. If that is some kind of magical &#34;we pick the best one for you&#34; type of thing, I'd like the option to see that data. Finally, lets talk about the price shall we? This is a pretty expensive product. You could get the same &#34;mesh&#34; functionality from Ubiquiti's UniFi or use some power-line devices if you just need to connect a couple of devices away from your modem. WiFi range extenders are a cheaper option although they aren't nearly as slick or reliable.Then we have this awful moment;  The 2 devices that aren't wired directly into my modem would randomly disconnect and show a red status light. They'd come back after 30-60 seconds but this constant up/down cycle went on for days. Instead of fussing with it, I fired up the app, navigated through the help section and emailed support with the information requested. Then --- crickets. No acknowledgement, no reply, no help. searching some internet forums, I'm not the only one to have this issue. I basically had to remove everything and go through the setup routine all over again while moving the 2 wireless APs around a little bit to get  a better signal. Not exactly sure why it ran fine for so long then suddenly became unstable, but it did.I thought the lack of any response from support may have just been an oversight so I followed up the original ticket with a second request. Nothing again. Unfortunately, it appears that email support is non-existent. I didn't call the phone number but, I don't think I should have to. These are not cheap by any measure. Maybe the time, money, and effort put into the pretty packaging would have been better spent ensuring that customer support was top notch. I'd rather the product came in a brown paper bag and get stellar customer support than pretty packaging but nobody to answer my email.Overall, if you care about aesthetics and you want to cover a large area with seamless WiFi, this is a great product. If you are more price sensitive, take a look at some of the alternatives. And finally, if you are not comfortable with suspect customer service, you may want to wait while, what I assume are growing pains, are resolved before you purchase.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXS5OYHO0BH23/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A3HAWR8RE0LKDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"

"Stanley Grant",17-Aug-2016,1,"Very unreliable","I really wanted to like the eero.  Unfortunately, it does exactly what it says it does and that is the problem for me.  When the eero is up and running, it is a delight to use.  I get great coverage, fast speeds, and updates when I’m not using it.  The problem is that when something goes wrong, there is no way to tell why.  Is it because of updates?  Did my cable modem drop?  Did one of the units crash?  All I get is “offline”.Also, the system is smart about when updates occur, but if you change your schedule, it doesn’t seem to adjust.  For the last week, I’ve needed to get up an hour earlier than normal.  Each day, I’ve woken up to all of the eeros “offline”.  The first day, I figured it was updating, let it go and used my phone instead.  If it was an update, it took over an hour and left two of the units (I have four) offline afterwards until I rebooted them much later in the day.  The second day, same thing, but I rebooted the units.  This is day three and to say I’m frustrated is an understatement.  I ended up plugging in my old router, found the network was there, the eero just went “offline” for some reason.Here are the problems for me:• Cannot schedule updates – days where I change my schedule leave me hanging high and dry for network access• No way to tell why the units go offline – the units seem to go offline frequently (couple of times a week).  No way to tell why or how to fix it other than walking around and rebooting them• Updates take a long time – I’ve seen the network go down for as much as an hour and then come back up.  Assuming that was for an update as the cable modem was still connected to the internetThe bottom line is that when it works, it’s great.  When it doesn’t you’re left guessing and going around rebooting units – just like any other router (except with those, I can at least figure out what’s going on).  So, I see these as faster, less reliable versions of the routers I replaced them with.  Personally, I’ll take the speed hit in order to have better reliability.  After a month and a half, I’m already regretting the purchase and looking to replace eero with something else.Update:It's been one week since my 2 star review.  Lowering to 1 star.  Every single day, the network is out in the morning.  Just this week, it has gone out at night before I go to bed twice.  Why is it out?  Who knows?  Who cares?  Bottom line is I'm spending more time without network access on the eero network for no reason that I can figure out (old router still gives access - had to plug it back in to deal with the eero outages).  These routers are complete garbage.  They worked great for the first month, but now instead of having to reboot two routers a couple of times a month, I'm having to reboot four routers... every... single... day!  Sometimes more than once a day.  I'm done with these.  I'm going back to my old network config.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GM3JOAEBNJUN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEW3YD6","https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/APNRDXLYQJE6V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8"
