"Probie15",15-Apr-2017,1,"What HAPPENED to service?","While it's nice to be able to order food and have it delivered, when GrubHub expanded their ""service,"" the    s e r v i c e part didn't expand. When you order from a place 2.8 miles from your house, are told it will be delivered in 30-minutes ... but it takes an 1.5 hours, there's something just wrong. Then, when you call in and find out the driver already marked your order as delivered (when no such thing happened) and all GrubHub will do is make excuses ... again, there's something wrong.","",""

"Hubbz127",14-Apr-2017,4,"Great delivery app!","I love GrubHub because it makes it really simple to order and I've always had a great experience. I give it a 4 because if a restaurant is closed you can't view the menu and prepare an order for later when it opens up. Also not a massive fan of the minimum order requirements and all the fees. It would be great to be able to order one or two appetizers without having to add extra food. What would've been a &15 order ends up being &30. Like...why?","",""

It was my first time ordering through grub hub , and I ordered sushi with rice and miso soup, by the time I got my food (45 mins later than the delivery service estimated the time to be ) it was cold soggy mushy it smelled of rotten fish and was saturated in lemon juice to keep the avocados from going bad. But besides my critics for the restaurant, the food was all in one side of the Togo box and my soup was just broth with noting in it .

"James B 508",12-Apr-2017,1,"Horrible customer service, high delivery fees","High, ever-increasing delivery fees. No customer service to be spoken of. 

Most recent experience will be my last. Their drivers screwed up my &50 order and 2 hours later I was still on the phone with ""customer service"" who only offered me a &10 voucher for my troubles, the worst part was my kids only received one order and I still hadn't eaten. Terrible accountability on behalf of every part of their operation. 

DO NOT USE THiS APP","",""
"Schmekoman",12-Apr-2017,2,"Ehh","GrubHub is great because it tends to be a little less expensive than its competitors (e.g. Door Dash and Uber Eats) however, that being said, their customer service is sub-par. Actually, it's embarrassingly inadequate. As I recall, I placed an order, and the delivery time kept being pushed back, and not due to the restaurant's incompetency. The driver was so late picking up the order, the store had already closed. Eventually I was able to get things straight with the ""customer service"" department and the food was delivered. As a token of ""I'm sorry"", the delivery guy gave me a &10 coupon to use on my next order. At that point I was pleased. It seemed that GrubHub took the initiative to rectify the situation. The next time I placed an order, I was happy to use this coupon, and to my dismay, the coupon was indeed a &10 discount.... for first time orders only. What am I supposed to do with that? Use it as a napkin? So basically at the end of the day, GrubHub did not rectify anything... which is a disappointment, because the service they offer is of value. It's just too bad that they don't care about their customers.","",""

First, it took over an hour and a half to get here. Second, the tacos and burritos I ordered were wet,soggy,and cold. They did send me a text saying my food was late and they ""gave me free grub"" which turned out to be chips. I gave them another star just for the notification.

"lornajay224",12-Apr-2017,3,"50/50","It's about a 50/50 chance if my order actually gets placed correctly thought the GrubHub system and gets to the restaurant as it should. On many occasions, I've placed and order and it never actually gets to the restaurants system, thus no food. I always get a &5 credit, which would be fine if this didn't happen so often.

For the two years I've been using it, my main complaint is that the app doesn't display restaurant hours and will still allow you to order from closed restaurants. So you end up ordering food and then it never shows up until the next morning (or sometimes not at all).
It's happened around 6-7 times, so I've taken to checking google for the hours and calling the restaurant if it's within an hour of closing time.
